 * @brief Class MultiblockGriddingAlgorithm<DIM> manages gridding operations in
 * SAMRAI for problems on multiblock domains.  Specifically, it provides AMR
 * patch hierarchy generation and regridding routines that may be used with
 * a variety of AMR solution algorithms and application-specific numerical
 * routines.
 *
 * The three main functions provided by this class are:
 *    - @b    makeCoarsestLevel()
 *       This routine constructs or repartitions
 *       the coarsest hierarchy level (level 0).
 *
 *    - @b    makeFinerLevel()
 *       This routine will attempt to add a new
 *       finest level to the hierarchy if the
 *       maximum number of levels allows it and
 *       cells on the current finest level are
 *       selected for refinement.
 *
 *    - @b    regridAllFinerLevels()
 *       This routine will regrid all levels finer
 *       than some specified level based on cells
 *       that are selected for refinement on each
 *       level finer than and including the given
 *       level.  This routine may add a new finest
 *       hierarchy level if the maximum number of
 *       levels allows it and cells on the current
 *       finest level are selected for refinement.
 *       Levels may also be removed from the
 *       hierarchy if no cells are tagged.
 *
 *
 * These basic AMR operations are used to generate of individual levels in
 * the AMR patch hierarchy at the beginning of a simulation, and regridding
 * collections of levels during an adaptive calculation.  More details are
 * found in the comments accompanying each member function below.
 *
 * The operations that identify cells for refinement on a single level and
 * initialize data and solution algorithm-specific information that depend
 * on the AMR hierarchy configuration are provided by the data member of
 * type mesh::TagAndInitializeStrategy<DIM>.  Operations that cluster
 * tagged cells into a collection of box regions are provided by the
 * mesh::BoxGeneratorStrategy<DIM> data member.  Routines that load balancing
 * patches on each level are provided by the mesh::LoadBalanceStrategy<DIM> data
 * member.  The collaboration between this class and each of those objects
 * follows the Strategy design pattern.  Each instantiation of this gridding
 * algorithm class is configured with concrete implementations of those
 * routines by passing appropriate objects into this constructor.
 *
 * Initialization of an MultiblockGriddingAlgorithm<DIM> object is performed
 * via a combination of default parameters and values read from input.  Data
 * read from input is summarized as follows:
 *
 * Required input keys and data types:
 *
 *    - \b    max_levels
 *       Integer value specifying maximum number of levels
 *       allowed in the AMR patch hierarchy.
 *
 *    - \b    largest_patch_size
 *       An array of integer vectors (each has length = DIM) that specify
 *       the dimensions of largest patch allowed on each level in the
 *       hierarchy.  The index of the vector in the array corresponds to the
 *       number of the level to which it applies.  If more values are given
 *       than the maximum number of levels, extra entries will be ignored.
 *       If fewer values are given, then the last element in the array will
 *       be used on each level without a specified input value.  For example,
 *       if only a single value is specified, then that value will be used on
 *       all levels.  See sample input below for more information.
 *
 *    - \b    ratio_to_coarser
 *       Set of max_levels - 1 integer vectors, each of which indicates
 *       the ratio of the index space of a patch level to that of the next
 *       coarser level.  The input for each level must correspond to the
 *       format ``level_n = vector'', where n is the level number and each
 *       vector must have length DIM.  See sample input below.
 *
 *
 * Optional input keys, data types, and defaults:
 *
 *    - \b    efficiency_tolerance
 *       An array of double values, each of which specifies the minimum
 *       percentage of tagged cells in each box used to construct patches
 *       on a finer level.  If the ratio of the number of tagged cells in
 *       a box to total cells in the box is below the tolerance value, the
 *       box may be split into smaller boxes and pieces removed until the
 *       ratio becomes greater than or equal to the the tolerance.  The index
 *       of the value in the array corresponds to the number of the level to
 *       which the tolerance value applies.  If more values are given
 *       than max_levels - 1 , extra entries will be ignored.  If fewer
 *       values are given, then the last element in the array will be used
 *       on each level without a specified input value.  For example,
 *       if only a single value is specified, then that value will be used on
 *       all levels.  If no input values are given, a default of 0.8 is used.
 *       See sample input below for input file format.
 *
 *    - \b    combine_efficiency
 *       An array of double values, each of which serves as a threshold
 *       for the ratio of the total number of cells in two boxes into which
 *       a box may be split and the number of cells in the original box.
 *       If that ratio is greater than combine efficiency, the box will not
 *       be split.  This avoids splitting up portions of the domain into
 *       potentially more costly smaller pieces if there appears to be little
 *       to be gained by splitting up the boxes.  The index of the value in
 *       the array corresponds to the number of the level to which the
 *       efficiency value applies.  If more values are given than
 *       max_levels - 1 , extra entries will be ignored.  If fewer values
 *       are given, then the last element in the array will be used on each
 *       level without a specified input value.  For example, if only a single
 *       value is specified, then that value will be used on all levels.  If
 *       no input values are given, a default of 0.8 is used.  See
 *       sample input below for input file format.
 *
 *    - \b    smallest_patch_size
 *       An array of integer vectors (each has length = DIM) that specify
 *       the dimensions of smallest patch allowed on each level in the
 *       hierarchy.  The smallest patch allowed must be at least as great as
 *       the maximum ghost cell width for all variables in the problem.  If
 *       some smaller patch size is given in input, then it will be overridden
 *       with a value consistent with the maximum ghost width.   The index of
 *       the vector in the array corresponds to the number of the level to
 *       which it applies.  If more values are given than the maximum number
 *       of levels, extra entries will be ignored.  If fewer values are given,
 *       then the last element in the array will be used on each level without
 *       a specified input value.  For example, if only a single value is
 *       specified, then that value will be used on all levels.  If no input
 *       is given, a default of the maximum ghost cell width over all
 *       variables is used.  See sample input below for input file format.
 *
 *    - \b    proper_nesting_buffer
 *       An integer array specifying the number of coarse cells by which the
 *       next finer level is nested within the interior of the domain of the
 *       next coarser level when creating a new level.  If more values are
 *       given than max_levels - 1 , extra entries will be ignored.  If fewer
 *       values are given, then the last element in the array will be used
 *       on each level without a specified input value.  For example,
 *       if only a single value is specified, then that value will be used on
 *       all levels.  If no values are given, a default of 1 is used for each
 *       nesting buffer value.  See sample input below for input file format.
 *
 *    - \b    allow_patches_smaller_than_ghostwidth
 *       In order to enforce minimum patch size restrictions, boxes may be
 *       grown in gridding operations.  This may in turn lead to overlaps
 *       created between boxes. If overlaps are undesirable and you are
 *       willing to relax the minimum size constraints, set this parameter
 *       true.  By default, it is false.
 *
 *    - \b    write_regrid_boxes
 *       Output sequence of refine boxes to file.
 *
 *    - \b    read_regrid_boxes
 *       Read sequence of refine boxes from file.
 *
 *    - \b    regrid_boxes_filename
 *       Filename used for writing or reading refine boxes.
 *       The read and write boxes option is usable only under very specific
 *       circumstances. Please contact the SAMRAI developers at
 *       samrai\@llnl.gov) for more information.
 *
 *
 * Note that when continuing from restart, the input values in the
 * input file override all values read in from the restart database.

    * @brief Create level 0 for a hierarchy
    *
    * This routine will attempt to construct the coarsest level in an AMR
    * multiblock patch hierarchy (i.e., level 0).  If level 0 does not already
    * exist, then the domain specification is checked against the constraints

    * is maintained by the grid geometry object associated with the hierarchy.
    * Generally, an unrecoverable exception will result if the constraints
    * are not satisfied.
    *
    * If level 0 already exists in the hierarchy, then the routine will
    * generate a new level by re-applying the load balancing procedure to
    * the existing level.  Data will be moved from the old level to the
    * new level and the pre-existing level 0 will be discarded.  Note that

    * which is used to construct levels 1 and finer.  In particular, this
    * routine does not select cells for refinement, whereas the other
    * routine does.
    *
    * Important note: If assertion checking is turned on, then an

    * or its grid geometry is NULL.

    * @brief Create new finer level in hierarchy
    *
    * This routine attempts to create a new level in an AMR patch hierarchy
    * finer than the finest level currently residing in the hierarchy.
    * It will select cells for refinement on the finest level and construct
    * a new finest level, if necessary.  If no cells are selected for

    * individual levels during the construction of the AMR hierarchy at the
    * initial simulation time.  If false, the routine is being used to add
    * new levels to the hierarchy at some later point.  In either case, the
    * time value is the current simulation time.  Note that this routine

    * Thus, the buffer size should take into account how the simulation may
    * evolve before regridding occurs (e.g., number of timesteps taken).

    * @brief Regrid all levels finer that a specified level
    *
    * This routine attempts to reconfigure the patches on each level in
    * an AMR patch hierarchy which is finer than the specified level.  The
    * given level number is that of the coarsest level on which cells will be
    * will be selected for refinement.  In other words, that level is the
    * finest level that will not be subject to a change in its patch
    * configuration during the regridding process.  Generally, this routine
    * should be used to alter a pre-existing AMR patch hierarchy based on
    * the need to adapt the computational mesh around some phenomenon of
    * interest.  The routine makeFinerLevel() above should be used to
    * construct an initial hierarchy configuration or to add more than one
    * new level into the hierarchy.  Also, this routine will not reconfigure
    * the patches on level 0 (i.e., the coarsest in any hierarchy).  The
    * routine makeCoarsestLevel() above is provided for that purpose.
    *
    * Note that the current algorithm permits at most one new finest level
    * to be added to the hierarchy with each invocation of the regridding
    * process.  This constraint, though seemingly restrictive makes the
    * process of maintaining properly nested levels much easier.
    *
    * The tag buffer array indicates the number of cells by which cells
    * selected for refinement on a level will be buffered before new finer
    * level boxes are constructed.  The buffer is important to keep phenomena
    * of interest on refined regions of the mesh until adaptive regridding
    * occurs next.  Thus, the buffer size should take into account how the
    * simulation may evolve before regridding occurs (e.g., number of
    * timesteps taken on each level).
    *
    * The boolean argument level_is_coarsest_to_sync is used for regridding in
    * time-dependent problems.  When true, it indicates that the specified
    * level is the coarsest level to synchronize at the current regrid time
    * before this regridding method is called.  This is a pretty

    * memory is managed during time-dependent regridding operations.
