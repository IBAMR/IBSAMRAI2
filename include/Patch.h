 * are subclasses of the patch data pure virtual base class.  The construction
 * of the patch data objects on a patch are managed via the factory classes
 * maintained by the patch descriptor.

 * By default, the patch constructor does not allocate space for the various
 * patch data components that live on the patch.  Individual components or sets
 * of components can be instantiated or destroyed via patch member functions.
