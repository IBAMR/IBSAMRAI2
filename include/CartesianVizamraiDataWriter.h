/*!
 * Class CartesianVizamraiDataWriter<DIM> is used by SAMRAI-based 
 * application codes to generate Vizamrai data files.  Vizamrai provides 
 * a wide range of visualization and post-processing capabilities 
 * for data generated on a structured AMR patch hierarchy.  Vizamrai 
 * supports cell-centered mesh data.  This class supports cell-centered
 * data where the underlying data type is either double, float, or int. 
 *
 * This data file writer class can be used to generate Vizamrai data
 * files when the underlying mesh geometry is managed by a
 * geom::CartesianGridGeometry<DIM> object.  Two kinds of data quantities are 
 * supported by this class.  The first is data that resides on an AMR patch 
 * hierarchy when a data file is generated.  The second is "derived" data 
 * that can be computed using data on an AMR patch hierarchy.  The first data 
 * type requires no user intervention when generating a plot file.  The second 
 * type, or "derived" data, requires that a user implement a concrete class 
 * derived from the VisDerivedDataStrategy<DIM> abstract interface.  In 
 * an overloaded function of that class, a user generates the "derived" data 
 * quantity and writes it to a specified file stream.   In either case, scalar or
 * variable data quantities are supported.
 *
 * Before a Vizamrai data writer object can be used to generate Vizamrai
 * data files, it must first be constructed and initialized.  Initialization
 * involves things like setting information about the levels in the AMR 
 * hierarchy that will be plotted, setting the type of the data to write
 * out (e.g., double or float), setting the directory into which plot
 * files are written, and registering variable quantities to send
 * to the plot file.  After initialization, the object can be used to 
 * generate a series of data files during the execution of some simulation
 * code.
 *
 * Typical usage of this Vizamrai data writer object involves several
 * steps among which are variations.  Basic usage is as follows:
 * -# Create a Cartesian Vizamrai data writer object.
 * -# Set the finest level to plot with the member function 
 *       setFinestLevelToPlot().  This is the finest level allowable 
 *       in any plot file; however, only levels in the hierarchy will
 *       be written out.
 * -# For each level OTHER THAN THE COARSEST , specify
 *       the ratio between the index space of the level and the next
 *       coarser level in the AMR hierarchy.  This information 
 *       is needed for scaling the AMR levels properly in Vizamrai.  The
 *       member function to use is setRatioToCoarserLevel().
 * -# Set the type of data to put in the Vizamrai file, using either
 *       setPlotDataToDouble(), or setPlotDataToFloat().  The default is
 *       to write float data.
 * -# Set the directory for the plot files if desired using the function
 *       setDirectoryName().  If no directory is specified, files will
 *       be written into the current directory. 
 * -# If any "derived" quantities will be generated, set the concrete
 *       derived data writer object using setDerivedDataWriter().  
 *       Alternatively, one may specify a derived data writer when registering
 *       each derived data quantity.  This provides flexibility in using 
 *       different derived data writers for different quantities if desired.
 * -# Register data quantities using either registerPlotScalar()/registerPlotVector() or
 *       registerDerivedPlotScalar()/registerDerivedPlotVector().  Derived data quantities 
 *       require only a string identifier and a derived data writer if not specified
 *       earlier.  All other quantities require a string identifier and
 *       an index into the patch data array on the AMR hierarchy.  A scale
 *       factor may also be specified.  Note that you cannot register more
 *       than one variable with the same name.  If this is attempted, an 
 *       error message is logged and the program will exit.
 * -# The resetLevelPlotScalar()/resetLevelPlotVector() member functions 
 *       are provided for cases when a plot quantity lives at different 
 *       patch data indices on different levels.  Calling this routine 
 *       redefines the patch data index for a given quantity on a given 
 *       level that will be written to a plot file.  Before this function 
 *       is called, the quantity must be registered using the 
 *       registerPlotScalar()/registerPlotVector() function.
 * -# Finally, the writer can be used to generate Vizamrai data files
 *       using the member function writePlotData().  Minimally, only
 *       a hierarchy and a file name is needed.  One can also supply an
 *       integer file extension and a plot time, both of which are useful 
 *       when generating visualization files for time-dependent applications.
 *
 * During the course of generating Vizamrai data files, certain features
 * of the plot files may change.  For example, the directory name can be
 * reset using the setDirectoryName() function.  Also, the finest level
 * to plot using the setFinestLevelToPlot() function.  Some restrictions
 * apply.  Please consult the member function documentation for more details.
