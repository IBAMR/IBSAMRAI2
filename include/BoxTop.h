/*!
 * Class BoxTop is a utility class that provides functionality
 * that can be used to reduce the runtime complexity of certain box
 * calculus operations.
 * 
 * A BoxTop object is constructed by passing the ctor a BoxArray;
 * this array is used internally to setup private data structures that
 * will be used in subsequent methods, described below. If the
 * BoxArray contains \b n boxes, then the setup phase (which is
 * invoked by the constructor) has a runtime complexity of O(n log(n)).
 * 
 * Following construction, two types of operations are supported.
 * First, the three related functions findOverlappingBoxes,
 * findOverlappingBoxIndices, and findOverlappingBoxesAndIndices
 * take a box as input, and compute the subset of the boxes, and/or
 * the indices of the boxes, that overlap with the box.
 * 
 * Second, the removeIntersections call takes a list of boxes as
 * input, and removes those portions that intersect with the boxes
 * in the BoxArray that was passed to the constructor.
 * 
 * @see hier::Box
 * @see hier::BoxArray
