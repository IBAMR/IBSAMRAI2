/*!
 *  @brief Utility class to construct and maintain a description of the coarse-fine
 *  boundary between a patch level and some coarser level.
 *
 *  A coarse-fine boundary box is a BoundaryBox object, but it is generated
 *  differently than a typical boundary box maintained by a patch geometry object.
 *  The boundary type and location identifiers for regular boundary boxes apply
 *  to coarse-fine boundary boxes.  However, a boundary box serving as a coarse-fine
 *  boundary box describes part of the boundary of a given patch with its next
 *  coarser AMR hierarchy level.  It does not intersect any other patch on the same
 *  level nor does it lie on a physical domain boundary, except where the physical
 *  boundary is periodic and the appropriate continuation of that boundary is part
 *  of a coarser patch level.
 *
 *  The coarse-fine boundary is created from two adjacent hierarchy levels (typically),
 *  but the description lives on (refers to the index space of) the finer level.
 *  Since the coarse-fine boundary describes the boundary to the next coarser level,
 *  the coarsest level (i.e., level zero in an AMR hierarchy) has no coarse-fine
 *  boundary.
 *
 *  Each CoarseFineBoundary object corresponds to one level,
 *  so to represent a hierarchy, you would need an array or list of
 *  such objects.
