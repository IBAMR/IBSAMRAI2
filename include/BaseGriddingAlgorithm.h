    * @brief Construct the coarsest level in a hierarchy (i.e., level 0).
    *
    * If level 0 does not already exist, then the domain specification is
    * checked against the constraints of the grid generation procedures.
    * The level gridding strategy data member defines these constraints.
    * Recall that the domain specification is maintained by the grid geometry
    * associated with the hierarchy.  Generally, an unrecoverable
    * exception will result if the constraints are not satisfied.
    * 
    * If level 0 already exists in the hierarchy, then the routine will 
    * generate a new level by re-applying the load balancing procedure to 
    * the existing level.  Data will be moved from the old level to the 
    * new level and the pre-existing level 0 will be discarded.  Note that 
    * this routine is different than the routine makeFinerLevel() below, 
    * which is used to construct levels 1 and finer.  In particular, this
    * routine does not select cells for refinement, whereas the other 
    * routine does.
    *
    * Important note: If assertion checking is turned on, then an 
    * unrecoverable assertion will result if either the patch hierarchy 
    * or its grid geometry is NULL.
    *
    * The two optional arguments are only to be used for a special case where
    * the user wishes to manually specify a box decomposition and load
    * balance for the coarsest level of the hierarchy.  The BoxArray argument
    * must be a decomposition of the the coarsest level, and must exactly
    * fill the index space of the physical domain of the hierarchy.  The
    * ProcessorMapping must be constructed to map each box in the BoxArray
    * to a processor.  The size of the mapping must be equal to the length
    * of the box array, or an assertion failure will result.
    *
    * @param hierarchy The hierarchy on which coarse level is constructed.

    * @brief This routine attempts to create a new level in a hierarchy 
    * finer than the finest level currently residing in the hierarchy.  
    *
    * It will select cells for refinement on the finest level and construct 
    * a new finest level, if necessary.  If no cells are selected for 
    * refinement, no new level will be added to the hierarchy.   The boolean 
    * argument initial_time indicates whether the routine is called at the 
    * initial simulation time.  If true, this routine is used to build 
    * individual levels during the construction of the AMR hierarchy at the 
    * initial simulation time.  If false, the routine is being used to add 
    * new levels to the hierarchy at some later point.  In either case, the 
    * time value is the current simulation time.  Note that this routine 
    * cannot be used to construct the coarsest level in the hierarchy
    * (i.e., level 0).  The routine makeCoarsestLevel() above must be used
    * for that purpose.
    *
    * The tag buffer indicates the number of cells by which cells selected
    * for refinement will be buffered before new finer level boxes are 
    * constructed.  The buffer is important to keep phenomena of interest 
    * on refined regions of the mesh until adaptive regridding occurs next.
    * Thus, the buffer size should take into account how the simulation may 
    * evolve before regridding occurs (e.g., number of timesteps taken).
    *
    * Important note: If assertion checking is activated, several checks
    * are applied to the functions arguments.  If any check is violated,
    * an unrecoverable assertion will result.  In particular, the hierarchy 
    * pointer must be non-NULL and the given level number must match that of

    * @brief This routine attempts to reconfigure the patches on each level in
    * an AMR patch hierarchy which is finer than the specified level.
    *
    * The given level number is that of the coarsest level on which cells
    * will be selected for refinement.  In other words, that level is the 
    * finest level that will not be subject to a change in its patch 
    * configuration during the regridding process.  Generally, this routine
    * should be used to alter a pre-existing AMR patch hierarchy based on
    * the need to adapt the computational mesh around some phenomenon of 
    * interest.  The routine makeFinerLevel() above should be used to 
    * construct an initial hierarchy configuration or to add more than one
    * new level into the hierarchy.  Also, this routine will not reconfigure
    * the patches on level 0 (i.e., the coarsest in any hierarchy).  The
    * routine makeCoarsestLevel() above is provided for that purpose.
    *
    * Note that the current algorithm permits at most one new finest level 
    * to be added to the hierarchy with each invocation of the regridding 
    * process.  This constraint, though seemingly restrictive makes the 
    * process of maintaining properly nested levels much easier.
    *
    * The tag buffer array indicates the number of cells by which cells 
    * selected for refinement on a level will be buffered before new finer
    * level boxes are constructed.  The buffer is important to keep phenomena 
    * of interest on refined regions of the mesh until adaptive regridding 
    * occurs next.  Thus, the buffer size should take into account how the 
    * simulation may evolve before regridding occurs (e.g., number of 
    * timesteps taken on each level).
    *
    * The boolean argument is used for regridding in time-dependent 
    * problems.  When true, it indicates that the specified level is
    * the coarsest level to synchronize at the current regrid time 
    * before this regridding method is called.  This is a pretty
    * idiosyncratic argument but allows some flexibility in the way 
    * memory is managed during time-dependent regridding operations.
    *
    * Important note: If assertion checking is activated, several checks
    * are applied to the functions arguments.  If any check is violated,
    * an unrecoverable assertion will result.  In particular, the hierarchy
    * pointer must be non-NULL and the given level number must match that of
    * of some level in the hierarchy.  Also, the tag buffer array must 
    * contain a positive value for each level in the hierarchy.
