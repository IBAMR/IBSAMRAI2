 * @brief Abstract base class defining the interface for all concrete transaction 
 * factory objects that generate data transaction objects used with a 
 * LocallyActiveDataCoarsenSchedule<DIM> object.  A concrete subclass will allocate 
 * new transaction objects.  This class is an example of the ``Abstract Factory'' 
 * method described in the Design Patterns book by Gamma, et al.
 *
 * To add a new type of Transaction object MyCoarsenTransaction:
 *
 * -# Implement a concrete LocallyActiveDataCoarsenTransactionFactory<DIM> object as a subclass
 *       that is derived from this LocallyActiveDataCoarsenTransactionFactory<DIM> base class.
 *       Implement the abstract virtual functions as appropriate for the 
 *       concrete subclass; in particular, the allocate() function must return 
 *       a new instance of the desired transaction object.
 * -# The type of the transaction allocated by the concrete factory is a 
 *       Transaction<DIM>.  Thus, the new transaction object must be derived
 *       from the Transaction<DIM> base class and implement the abstract 
 *       virtual functions declared by the base class.
 * 
 * @see tbox::Transaction
