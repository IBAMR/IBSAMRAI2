/*!
 * Class BoxTree is a utility class that provides functionality
 * that can be used to reduce the runtime complexity of certain box
 * calculus operations.
 * 
 * A BoxTree object is constructed by passing the ctor a BoxArray;
 * this array is used internally to setup private data structures that
 * will be used in subsequent methods, described below. If the
 * BoxArray contains \b n boxes, then the setup phase (which is
 * invoked by the constructor) has an expected runtime complexity 
 * of O(n log(n)).
 * 
 * Following construction, two types of operations are supported by the 
 * member functions findOverlapIndices() and findLocalOverlapIndices().  
 * Each function takes an integer array and a box as input, and computes 
 * the indices of the subset of the boxes (in the array that was passed 
 * to the constructor) that overlap with the argument box.  On return from 
 * the function, the integer array holds the indices of the boxes in the 
 * array that overlap with the argument box.  The function findOverlapIndices()
 * returns indices of all boxes that overlap the argument box.  The function
 * findLocalOverlapIndices() returns only the indices of the boxes that are
 * assigned to this processor.
 * 
 * Second, the removeIntersections call takes a list of boxes as
 * input, and removes those portions that intersect with the boxes
 * in the BoxArray that was passed to the constructor.
 *
 * This class provides functionality that is similar to that provided
 * by the BoxTop and BoxGraph classes.  However, it employs different
 * algorithms to do so, and is expected to have different runtime
 * characteristics.  Questions such as "which is faster for
 * removeIntersections(): BoxTop, BoxGraph, or BoxTree?" depends on many
 * factors for which analysis is difficult.  The answer is largely a
 * function of a particular problem and domain topology, and is best 
 * answered experimentally.

    * @brief Constructor for BoxTree.
    *
    * The primary difference between the constructors is that the first takes
    * processor mapping information while the others do not.  This is because
    * processor mapping information is required in the method
    * findLocalOverlapIndices(), but is not required for the other 
    * methods.
    *
    * If you do not pass processor mappying information, and subsequently call
    * findLocalOverlapIndices(), an unrecoverable assertion will be thrown.
    *
    * @param boxes input array of boxes.
    * @param box_shifts the amount by which each box is shifted when there
    *               are periodic boundary conditions.  If there are no
    *               periodic boundary conditions you can pass an array
    *               of length zero; otherwise the array must contain
    *               an entry for each box in \b boxes. 
    * @param box_mapping maps each box in \b boxes to a processor.
    * @param min_length controls the partitioning of \b boxes amongst 
    *                   child nodes in the tree.  
    *                   Setting to a larger value tends to
    *                   decrease the total number of nodes in the tree,
    *                   and hence reduces memory requirements; however, a 
    *                   larger value may also increase the cost of the
    *                   findOverlapBoxes and removeIntersections operations.
    *                   (and hence reduces memory requirements), but increase
    *                   the cost of findOverlapBoxes.  Unless you are
    *                   heavily invested in performance tweaking, please use
    *                   the default value.  Really, I mean it.
