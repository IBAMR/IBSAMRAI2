/*!
 * Class BoxGraph is a utility class that provides functionality
 * that can be used to reduce the runtime complexity of certain box calculus
 * operations.  Two types of functionality are provided.  First,
 * there is a getSrcOverlapIndices() method; second, there is a
 * removeIntersections() method.  These are described below.
 * 
 * BoxGraph is designed around the premise that you have two sets
 * of boxes: an array or source boxes (src_box_array), and an array
 * of destination boxes (dst_box_array).  The dst boxes are grown by
 * some number of cells in each coordinate direction to determine overlaps 
 * with the source boxes.  Typically, this is related to the ghost width of 
 * that data that resides on AMR hierachy patches that correspond to the boxes.
 * The getSrcOverlapIndices() and getLocalSrcOverlapIndices()
 * methods provide efficient methods to determine which boxes from the 
 * src_box_array overlap with a specified box from the dst_box_array.  
 * getSrcOverlapIndices() returns the indices of all source boxes that
 * overlap with a specified destination box. getLocalSrcOverlapIndices()
 * returns the indices of all source boxes that overlap with a specified 
 * destination box and are mapped to the same processor as the specified 
 * destination box.
 * 
 * The removeIntersections() method is similar in concept to the
 * BoxList<DIM>::removeIntersections() method.  Here, however, we
 * operate on the two arrays of boxes that are passed to the constructor.
 * The BoxGraph::removeIntersections() method is functionally equivalent
 * to the following:
 * 
 * @verbatim
 *      BoxList<DIM> dst_box_list(dst_box_array);
 *      BoxList<DIM> src_box_list(src_box_array);
 *      dst_box_list.removeIntersections(src_box_list);
 * @endverbatim
 * 
 * Note that the dst_box_array may be the same as the src_box_array.
 * This occurs, for example, during regridding operations when both
 * both levels are the same.
 * 
 * The above sequence of calls, however, has O(N^2) runtime complexity,
 * assuming both arrays of boxes contain N items.  This class typically
 * performs removeIntersections in O(N^3/2), although worst case behavior
 * can be shown to be O(N^5/2).
 * 
 * Internally BoxGraph operates by constructing a bipartite graph;
 * (this is performed in the constructor).  One set of independent vertices 
 * contains a vertex for each box in the src_box_array; the other independent 
 * set contains vertices corresponding to the dst_box_array.
 * The graph contains an edge (i,j) if
 *    (1) vertices i and j belong to different independent sets;
 *    (2) the boxes corresponding to the vertices overlap each other.
 *
 * Methods in this class were originally designed to improve efficiency
 * in xfer_RefineSchedule<DIM>::generateCommunicationSchedule().
