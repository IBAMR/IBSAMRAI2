 * Class BoxComm<DIM> is a utility class that provides support for
 * for broadcast and point-to-point communication of Boxes, BoxLists,
 * and BoxArrays.  All calls in this class are static.  Point-to-point
 * communication is blocking.  All functions fall through when SAMRAI
 * is compiled without MPI.
 * 
 * Note that this class is a utility class to group function calls in one
 * name space (all calls are to static functions).  Thus, you should never
 * attempt to instantiate a class of type BoxComm<DIM>; simply call the
 * functions as static functions using the BoxComm<DIM>::function(...)
 * syntax.
