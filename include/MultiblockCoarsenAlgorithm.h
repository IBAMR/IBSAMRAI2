/*!
 * @brief Class MultiblockCoarsenAlgorithm<DIM> encapsulates the AMR
 * communication pattern to coarsen data from a finer level to any coarser
 * level in a multiblock domain.  Most often, data is coarsened from the
 * interiors of source patch components on the source patch level into
 * interiors of patch components on the destination level.  If the
 * coarsening operators require ghost cells on a source component, then
 * sufficient ghost cell storage must be provided by the source patch data
 * component, and those ghost cells must be filled before calling the data
 * coarsening routines.
 *
 * Communication algorithms generally consist of three parts: an algorithm,
 * a schedule, and a patch strategy.  The algorithm describes the communication
 * between patch data items but is independent of the configuration of the
 * AMR hierarchy.  Patch data items and their associated coarsening operators
 * are registered with the algorithm.  To generate the communication
 * dependencies for a particular hierarchy configuration, the algorithm
 * generates a schedule based on the current hierarchy configuration.  This
 * schedule then performs the communication based on the registered data types
 * and their associated operators.  User-defined pre-processing and
 * post-processing are provided through the abstract patch strategy class.
 * The source patch data space is used during processing to store temporary
 * data.  Thus, the user-defined coarsening operators should operate on the
 * source space by using the patch data with those indices.
 *
 * Note that each coarsen schedule created by a coarsen algorithm remains
 * valid as long as the patches involved in the communication process do not
 * change as long as the patches involved in the communication process do not
 * change; thus, they can be used for multiple data communication cycles. 
 *
 *  Typical usage of a coarsen algorithm to perform data coarsening
 * on an AMR hierarchy involves four steps:
 *
 * -# Construct a coarsen algorithm object.
 * -# Register coarsen operations with the coarsen algorithm.  Using the
 *       registerCoarsen() methods(s), one provides source and destination
 *       patch data information, as well as spatial coarsening operators
 *       as needed.
 * -# After all operations are registered with the algorithm, one
 *       creates a communication schedule using the createSchedule()
 *       method.  This method identifies the source (fine) and destination
 *       (coarse) patch levels for data coarsening.  Note that when creating
 *       a communication schedule, a concrete instance of a
 *       MultiblockCoarsenPatchStrategy<DIM> object may be required to supply
 *       user-defined spatial data coarsening operations.
 * -# Invoke the coarsenData() method in the communication schedule to
 *       perform the data transfers.

    * Register a coarsening operation with the coarsening algorithm.  Data

    * will be coarsened into the source component of a temporary (coarse) patch
    * level and then copied into the destination component on the destination
    * (coarse) patch level.  If the coarsening operator requires data in ghost
    * cells outside of the patch interiors (i.e., a non-zero stencil width),
    * then those ghost cells must exist in the source patch data component
    * and the ghost cells must be filled with valid data on the source level
    * before a call to invoke the communication schedule.   Note that the
    * source and destination components may be the same in any case.
    *
    * Some special circumstances require that data be coarsened from the
    * ghost cell regions of a finer level and the resulting coarsened data
    * should be copied to the destination patch level.  When this is the case,
    * the optional integer vector argument should be set to the cell width, in
    * the destination (coarser) level index space, of the region around the
    * fine level where this coarsening should occur.  For example, if the
    * coarser level needs data in a region two (coarse) cells wide around the
    * boundary of the finer level, then the gcw_to_coarsen should be set to a
    * vector with all entries set to two.  Moreover, if the refinement ratio  
    * between coarse and fine levels is four in this case, then the source
    * patch data is required to have at least eight ghost cells.

    *                       interiors on the source level.  If this argument is
