/*!
 * @brief Class CoarsenAlgorithm<DIM> encapsulates the AMR communication
 * pattern to coarsen data from a finer level to any coarser level.  
 * Most often, data is coarsened from the interiors of source patch 
 * components on the source patch level into interiors of destination 
 * patch components on the destination level.  See comments for the
 * coarsen algorithm constructor for variations that are possible 
 * for (adventurous?) users. If the coarsening operators require ghost cells 
 * on a source component, then sufficient ghost cell storage must be provided 
 * by the source patch data component, and those ghost cells must be filled 
 * before calling the data coarsening routines.
 *
 * Communication algorithms generally consist of three parts: an algorithm,
 * a schedule, and a patch strategy.  The algorithm describes the communication
 * between patch data items but is independent of the configuration of the
 * AMR hierarchy.  hier::Patch data items and their associated coarsening
 * operators are registered with the algorithm.  To generate the communication
 * dependencies for a particular hierarchy configuration, the algorithm
 * generates a schedule based on the current hierarchy configuration.  This 
 * schedule then performs the communication based on the registered data types 
 * and their associated operators.  User-defined pre-processing and
 * post-processing are provided through the abstract patch strategy class.
 *
 * The source patch data space is used during processing to store temporary
 * data.  Thus, the user-defined coarsening operators should operate on the
 * source space by using the patch data with those indices.
 *
 * Note that each coarsen schedule created by a coarsen algorithm remains valid
 * as long as the patches involved in the communication process do not change;
 * thus, they can be used for multiple data communication cycles.
 *
 * Typical usage of a coarsen algorithm to perform data coarsening 
 * on an AMR hierarchy involves four steps:
 * 
 * -# Construct a coarsen algorithm object.
 * -# Register coarsen operations with the coarsen algorithm.  Using the
 *       registerCoarsen() methods(s), one provides source and destination
 *       patch data information, as well as spatial coarsening operators 
 *       as needed.  
 * -# After all operations are registered with the algorithm, one
 *       creates a communication schedule using the createSchedule()
 *       method.  This method identifies the source (fine) and destination
 *       (coarse) patch levels for data coarsening.  Note that when creating 
 *       a communication schedule, a concrete instance of a 
 *       CoarsenPatchStrategy<DIM> object may be required to supply 
 *       user-defined spatial data coarsening operations.
 * -# Invoke the coarsenData() method in the communication schedule to
 *       perform the data transfers.
 *
 * User-defined coarsening operations can be written using the interfaces
 * in CoarsenPatchStrategy for preprocessCoarsen() and postProcessCoarsen().
 * Users who use create these operations must note that all data that is to
 * be used in such operations should be registered with the CoarsenAlgorithm
 * using registerCoarsen(), whether or not the data is to be coarsened.

    * and the ghost cells must be filled with valid data on the source level
    * before a call to invoke the communication schedule.   Note that the

    * Some special circumstances require that data be coarsened from the 
    * ghost cell regions of a finer level and the resulting coarsened data 
    * should be copied to the destination patch level.  When this is the case,

    * coarser level needs data in a region two (coarse) cells wide around the
    * boundary of the finer level, then the gcw_to_coarsen should be set to a
    * vector with all entries set to two.  Moreover, if the refinement ratio
    * between coarse and fine levels is four in this case, then the source patch
