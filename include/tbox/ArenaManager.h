/**
 * Class ArenaManager is a Singleton class that acts as an abstract
 * factory for the arena memory management classes.  It is a single point
 * of control for memory allocation.  Class ArenaManager supports three
 * forms of memory management:  standard allocators, scratch allocators, and
 * fixed allocators.  Standard memory allocators are the ones to be used in
 * most cases; by default, the standard memory allocators use new and delete.
 * The scratch allocators are for temporary scratch space.  The fixed size
 * memory allocators are arenas of a fixed size from which many memory
 * requests will be made.
 *
 * See the Design Patterns book by Gamma {\em et al.} for more information
 * about the singleton pattern.
