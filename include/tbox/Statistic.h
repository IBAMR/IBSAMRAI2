/**
 * Class Statistic defines a simple object that can be used to record
 * information generated during the course of a simulation for post-
 * processing later.  Each statistic object is created by the singleton
 * Statistian object and is defined by a name string
 * identifier and is characterized by the sort of information it may record.
 * Depending on how the object is created, it may record processor
 * information (i.e., a separate value for each processor), or patch
 * information (i.e., a separate value for each patch on each processor).
 * An example of the former may be the total number of cells on each
 * processor.  An example of the second may be the number of cells on each
 * patch.  Each recorded data item may be any numerical value, but it 
 * will always be stored as a double for simplicity.  The string identifier 
 * for a processor stat is "PROC_STAT" and the string identifier for a 
 * patch stat is "PATCH_STAT".
 * 
 * An example use of a Statistic to record the number of gridcells on each
 * processor is as follows:
 *
 *    Pointer<Statistic> stat_num_gridcells =
 *        Statistician::getStatistician()->
 *        getStatistic("NumberGridcells", "PROC_STAT");
 *    ...
 *    stat_num_gridcells->recordProcStat(num_cells_on_proc);
 *    ...
 *
 * The type of the statistic restricts the way in which the statistic 
 * object may be used to record information.  For a "processor" stat
 * only the recordProcStat() functions can be used.  For a "patch"
 * stat only the recordPatchStat() functions can be used.
 * 
 * Typically, the information is recorded to generate a time sequence of
 * values.  But this need not be the case always.  An optional time
 * stamp may be provided for each value as it is recorded.  In any case,
 * the sequence order of the values is determined by the recording order.
 *
 * Also, the Statistician class is used to manage Statistic 
 * objects.  It provided a global point of access for creating and accessing
 * statistic objects and supports post-processing statistic information 
 * in parallel.
 *
 * In some cases, it may be desirable to record information for each
 * level in a calculation; e.g., the number of cells on each processor
 * on level zero, level 1, etc.  In this case, one can cimply create a
 * separate statistic object for each level.
