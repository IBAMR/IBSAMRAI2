/**
 * Class Pointer<TYPE> defines a smart pointer to TYPE.  It frees the
 * user from explicitly deleting and tracking aliases for object pointers.
 * It manages all reference counting and deallocation of the pointer (even
 * if the data was originally allocated from a memory arena).  When the
 * reference count on a Pointer<TYPE> object goes to zero, the object
 * is automatically deallocated.  A block with a references count and arena
 * pointer is allocated for all non-NULL pointers.  These reference counted
 * blocks are freed at the end of the lifetime of the pointer.
 *
 * Non-const pointers can be created only from other non-const pointers.
 * The non-const and const pointer classes have been designed so that an
 * attempted conversion from a const pointer into a non-const pointer causes
 * a compile-time error.  The const convention for this class is that any
 * member function that does not change the pointer object itself may be
 * const.  Note that this means that a const pointer does not mean that the
 * pointed-to object is const; these semantics require the const pointer class.
 *
 * Class Pointer<TYPE> performs type-checking when assigning pointers
 * of different TYPEs.  If a bad type conversion is performed, then the
 * destination pointer is set to NULL.
