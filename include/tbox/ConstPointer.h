/**
 * Class ConstPointer<TYPE> defines a smart const pointer to TYPE.
 * It frees the user from explicitly deleting and tracking aliases for
 * object pointers.  It manages all reference counting and deallocation
 * of the pointer (even if the data was originally allocated from a memory
 * arena).  When the reference count on a ConstPointer<TYPE> object
 * goes to zero, the object is automatically deallocated.  A block with a
 * references count and arena pointer is allocated for all non-NULL pointers.
 * These reference counted blocks are freed at the end of the lifetime of
 * the pointer.
 *
 * Const pointers can be created from either const or non-const pointers.
 * The non-const and const pointer classes have been designed so that an
 * attempted conversion from a const pointer into a non-const pointer causes
 * a compile-time error.
 *
 * Class ConstPointer<TYPE> performs type-checking when assigning
 * pointers of different TYPEs.  If a bad type conversion is performed,
 * then the destination pointer is set to NULL.
