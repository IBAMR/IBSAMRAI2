/*!
 * @brief Stage multiple asynchronous group communications
 * so that the collective can advance asynchronously
 * (as individual underlying MPI requests are completed).
 *
 * Use this class when you
 * - Have multiple group communications, each performed
 *   by a different AsyncCommGroup object.
 * - Want the multiple communications to proceed
 *   independently and asynchronously.
 *
 * This class allocates a set of AsyncCommGroup objects and
 * manages the space for their SAMRAI_MPI::request's.  The requests are
 * staged such that a single MPI_Waitany or MPI_Waitsome call
 * applies to all communication groups allocated by the stage.
 * Thus the communications performed by the AsyncCommGroup
 * objects can complete in the order allowed by the MPI messages.
 * The exact order is NOT deterministic!
 *
 * To advance the communication operation of any of the allocated
 * AsyncCommGroup objects, use advanceAny() or advanceSome().
 * In general, advanceSome() has better performance than advanceAny()
 * because it gets around the "starvation" problem.  See the MPI
 * documentation for a discussion of starvation.
 *
 * This class supports communication and uses MPI for
 * message passing.  If MPI is disabled, the job of this
 * class disappears and the class is effectively empty,
 * except for allocating and deallocating AsyncCommGroup
 * objects.  
 * The public interfaces still remain so the class
 * can compile, but the implementations are trivial.

   /*!
    * @brief Allocate a group in this stage.
    *
    * You may specify a handle associated with the allocated group
    * and pointing back to an object.
    * These pointers are returned when their group communications
    * are completed by the stage methods advanceAny() or advanceSome().
    * They help identify the user object waiting for the communication
    * to complete.
    *
    * To use the handle, create a user class inheritting from
    * RelaunchableJob so that any handle can be dynamically
    * casted back to the user class.
    *
    * Usage outline:
    * -# Derive class UserClass from RelaunchableJob.
    *    Implement the pure virtual interfaces therein.
    * -# Associate a UserClass object with a AsyncCommGroup
    *    object by using the address of the UserClass object to
    *    allocate the group.  See AsyncCommStage::allocateCommGroup().
    * -# Use the allocated group to initiate a group communication.
    * -# Repeat the above for any number of user objects.
    * -# Determine the specific user object associated with the
    *    communication completed by AsyncCommStage::advanceAny()
    *    and AsyncCommStage::advanceSome() by dynamically
    *    casting the output RelaunchableJob pointer to 
    *    pointers to UserClass objects.
    *
    * Usage example:
    * @verbatim
    * class UserClass : RelaunchableJob { ... };
    * UserClass user_object[10];
    * AsyncCommStage stage;
    * for ( i=0; i<10; ++i ) {
    *    AsyncCommGroup *group =
    *      stage.allocateCommGroup( 2, &user_object[i] );
    *    useGroupToInitiateCommunication(group);
    * }
    * RelaunchableJob *handle = stage.advanceAny();
    * UserClass *completed_user_object = dynamic_cast<UserClass*>(handle);
    * @endverbatim
    *
    * Allocating a group with a NULL handle works, but
    * you lose the ability to map a specific communication
    * back to a user object.  See advanceAny() and advanceSome().
    *
    * An allocated group should be deallocated using the delete operator
    * when no longer needed.  All allocated groups will be deleted
    * when the stage goes out of scope.  Since it is an error to
    * delete a group that has pending message requests, it is also
    * an error to delete a stage that has groups with pending
    * message requests.
    *
    * @param nchild Number of child branches per tree node
    *               (see AsyncCommGroup).
