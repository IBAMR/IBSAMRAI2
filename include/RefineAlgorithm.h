 * @brief Class RefineAlgorithm<DIM> encapsulates the AMR communication
 * pattern to refine data to, copy data to, or fill physical boundary data on 
 * any destination patch level.  The basic procedure for moving data follows 
 * three steps: 
 * -# interpolate data (spatial and possibly temporal) from coarser levels
 * -# copy data from the same level of refinement
 * -# fill physical boundary conditions regions
 * 
 * Each data communication procedure generally consists of three parts: an 
 * algorithm, a schedule, and a patch strategy.  The algorithm describes 
 * the patch data components and time and space interpolation operations,
 * but is independent of the configuration of the patches in an AMR hierarchy.  
 * Patch data items and their associated spatial and time interpolation 
 * operators are registered with an instantiation of this algorithm class.  
 * To generate the communication dependencies for a particular patch hierarchy 
 * configuration, the algorithm creates a refine schedule based on the state 
 * of a given hierarchy and the information in the algorithm.  The schedule 
 * can then perform the communication operations that move data to the
 * destination patch level using the associated operators.  User-defined
 * operations (such as filling physical boundaries and special interpolation
 * procedures) are provided through a refine patch strategy object.
 *
 * In general, source data is copied into the designated scratch data for
 * temporary processing.  The scratch space must contain sufficient ghost
 * cells to accommodate the stencil width of the given interpolation operators
 * and any physical boundary data that must be filled.  The scratch storage is 
 * copied into the destination data space at the end of the communication process.  
 * Thus, copy operations between source, scratch, and destination patch data 
 * objects must be defined.  In general, it is the user's responsibility to 
 * register valid operations with the refine algorithm so that the data 
 * communication can occur.
 *
 * In general, the destination and scratch data components may be the same 
 * (assuming that the scratch component has a sufficient ghost cells width).
 * The source and scratch components SHOULD NOT be the same, since the
 * interiors of the source space would be changed by the use of the scratch
 * data as temporary work space.
 *
 * Note that each refine schedule created by a refine algorithm remains valid
 * as long as the patches involved in the communication process do not change;
 * thus, they can be used for multiple data communication cycles.
 *
 * Typical usage of a refine algorithm to perform inter-patch communication
 * on an AMR hierarchy involves four steps:
 *
 * -# Construct a refine algorithm object.
 * -# Register refine operations with the refine algorithm.  Using the
 *       registerRefine() methods(s), one provides source and destination
 *       patch data information, as well as time and space interpolation
 *       operators as needed.  Two registerRefine() methods appear in this
 *       class; one supports time interpolation, one does not.
 * -# After all operations are registered with the algorithm, one
 *       creates a communication schedule using one of the createSchedule()
 *       methods.  These methods are distinguished by the resulting data
 *       communication pattern (e.g., interpatch communication on a single
 *       level, between two different levels at the same grid resolution, 
 *       interpolation of data between different AMR hierarchy levels, etc.)
 *       Note that when creating a communication schedule, a concrete
 *       instance of a RefinePatchStrategy<DIM> object may be required
 *       to supply physical boundary conditions as well as user-defined
 *       spatial data interpolation operations.
 * -# Invoke the fillData() method in the communication schedule to 
 *       perform the data transfers.        
 *
 * User-defined interpolation operations can be written using the interfaces
 * in RefinePatchStrategy for preprocessRefine() and postProcessRefine().
 * Users who use create these operations must note that all data that is to
 * be used in such operations should be registered with the RefineAlgorithm
 * using registerRefine(), whether or not the data is to be refined.
