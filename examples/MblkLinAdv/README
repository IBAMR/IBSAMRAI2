This example is similar to the single-block AMR LinAdv sample application.
Please see the README in that example for details on how to compile
and run.  This example has the following differences:

   1. It works on non-cartesian mapped grids 
   2. It works with multiblock grids
   3. All numerical kernel operations (e.g. computeFluxesOnPatch()) are
      c-based rather than fortran

The three test cases included are:

   1. cart-1blk   - single block Cartesian grid 
   2. wedge-1blk  - single block mapped wedge grid 
   3. octant-3blk - multi block (3 blocks) mapped octant grid 

Note that this example will compile in 2D but the numerics have not been fully
tested so it currently should only run in 3D.  For further information, please
