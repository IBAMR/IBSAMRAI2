This directory contains a set of example codes that illustrate use of 
various components in SAMRAI.  Some examples demonstrate formulation of 
applications using the different components in the library.  

The different examples are briefly discussed below.  For a more complete 
discussion of how to compile and run the examples, see the README in each 
of the example sub-directories.
 
AutomakeProject - demonstrates how to use SAMRAI in a new or existing
		  autoconf- and automake-managed project.

ConvDiff - Sample application which solves the convection diffusion
           equation using a simple adaptive Runge-Kutta integration
           algorithm without time refinement.

Euler  - Sample application which uses time refinement with a 
         Berger-Colella style adaptive hyperbolic integration 
         algorithm to solve the Euler equations.

LinAdv - Uses identical algorithm to the Euler example but solves
         the simpler Linear Advection equation.

timers - demonstrates addition of code timers and use of the 
         SAMRAI TimerManager to profile time spent in different
         parts of an application.

FAC - Sample application to solve Poisson's equation using the FAC
      algorithm implemented in FAC solver classes.
