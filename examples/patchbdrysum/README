The HierSumTest tests patch boundary node sum operations performed in the
PatchBoundaryNodeSum class.  

The test works as follows:

  1) Initially, set all CELL values to 1.0, except on coarser
     regions that are covered by finer regions where the cell
     values are set to 0.0.

  2) Set node/edge values equal to the sum of the cell values it aligns
     At this point, nodes on patch interiors will equal 2^NDIM and
     edges will equal 2^(NDIM-1) (i.e. the number of cells each align).  
     Node and edge values on patch boundaries will be less than this 
     because they are pulling in cell values of zero.
 
     On finer levels....
       o zero out cells on the coarser level for which fine level patches
         overlap. This assures nodes at the coarse-fine boundary will
         not get duplicate contributions from both fine and coarse
         levels during the sum.
       o set cells at the coarse-fine interface (i.e. the ghost region
         where fine patches intersect with coarser) to 1.0. 

  3) Do the outernode and outeredge sum operations   

  4) Check values.  All node values should equal 2^NDIM and all edge values
     should equal 2^(NDIM-1).  Nodes that have a finer level overlapping
     will be 0.0 on the interior of the patch.
