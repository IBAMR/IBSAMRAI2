This is an example of how to set up a new automake/autoconf-managed
project SAMRAI that uses SAMRAI.

Elements of this example can be used to add SAMRAI usage to an
existing automake/autoconf-managed project.

The tarball file is the resulting distribution file of the example.
The distribution file has enough of the original file to itself
become the original code.

For further instructions, unpack the tarball
(gzip -dc samtut-*.tar.gz | tar xvf).
