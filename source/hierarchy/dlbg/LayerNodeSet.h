/*!
  @brief Encapsulates a set of LayerNode objects on the same index space.

  This class is a part of the distributed box-graph management.
  The distributed box-graph is described in the LayerEdgeSet
  documentation.

  The primary purpose of this class is to organize local node data
  and (when applicable) nonlocal node data.  It performs the
  communication necessary to acquire data on nonlocal nodes.

  A @b local LayerNode is owned by the local process
  (see LayerNode for ownership).
  A @b remote LayerNode is owned by a remote process.

  An LayerNodeSet can be in one of two parallel states:
  - @b DISTRIBUTED: The local process knows only the local nodes
       in the set.
  - @b GLOBALIZED: All processes know all nodes in the set.

  The parallel state is changed by calling setParallelState().
  Note that going from DISTRIBUTED to GLOBALIZED state requires
  an all-to-all gather communication, the performance of which
  should be carefully considered if used frequently.
  The GLOBALIZED state also requires more memory.
  Going from GLOBALIZED state to distributed state is cheap.

  The general attributes of a LayerNodeSet are
  - the set of unique LayerNode objects,
  - the refinement ratio defining their index space, and
  - the parallel state.
  LayerNode objects uniqueness are based on their equality operator,
  which compares both owners and indices.  Therefore,
  a valid set does not contain two nodes with the same owner
  and index.
