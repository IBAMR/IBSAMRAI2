  @brief Encapsulates a set of DLBG edges that connect
  two LayerNodeSet objects.

  @b Distributed @b Layered @b Box-graph (DLBG):

  A box-graph is a graph where the @b nodes correspond to
  boxes and @b edges connect neighboring nodes.  Two nodes
  are @b neighbors if their boxes @b overlap when one is
  grown by some nominal @b ghost-cell-width.
  Each edge is defined by the two nodes it connects.
  The box-graph is useful in SAMR because it shows which
  boxes directly interact with each other.

  We can organize nodes of a box-graph into groups of
  boxes defined on the same index space.  When sorted
  from coarsest to finest index spaces, the nodes fall
  into distinct @b layers.
  A "layer" is similar to a level in the hierarchy in that
  patches in a level share the same index space.
  We use layer instead of level to differentiate the graph from
  the hierarchy and because a layer does not necessarily have
  a one-to-one association with a level.

  For convenience, we define
  - @b layer-node: A set of nodes in same layer (defined
    on the same index space).  This is encapsulated in the
    class LayerNodeSet.
  - @b layer-edge: Set of edges incident from a layer-node.
    This is encapsulated in the class LayerEdgeSet.

  An edge is directional, like an arrow, starting at a @b base
  node and ending at a @b head node.  Each pair of neighboring
  nodes has two edges, pointing in opposite directions.
  This goes also for LayerNodeSet and LayerEdgeSet objects.
  A single LayerEdgeSet object represents a set of directed edges
  incident from one base LayerNodeSet to one head LayerNodeSet.
  The edges pointing in the oposite direction are stored in a
  separate LayerEdgeSet object.

  An object of this class can be @e partnered with another object
  that represents the directed edges in the opposite direction.
  The head of one partner is the base of the other.
  The partner does not provide additional information
  but it does organize the information differently.
  If the edge data is represented as a matrix,
  then one partner is the transpose of the other.
  A partnership allows both objects to be modified
  simultaneously so that their data is consistent.
  This avoids having to modify one after the other,
  which is problematic because the second modification
  begins with inconsistent data.

  Two layers may contain edges in opposite directions and
  not be attached; but they would not be automatically
  coordinated in that case.

  In parallel, a LayerNodeSet can also be in distributed
  or globalized (see LayerNodeSet).  A locally-owned node
  is called a local node.  Nodes owned by other processors
  are remote notes.  Remote nodes are stilled called remote
  nodes when the LayerNodeSet is globalized.
  Local knowledge of a remote node does not make it local.

  In parallel, we may partition the layer-edge and store it
  across many processors.  The edge are classified as follows:
  - @b Local @b edges are incident from a local base
    and incident to two local head.
  - @b Semi-local @b edges are incident from a local base
    and incident to a remote head.
  - @b Remote @b edges connect two remote nodes.

  The @b parallel @b state of a LayerEdgeSet object can be:
  -# @b DISTRIBUTED: An object in this state stores only
     edges incident from local nodes.
  -# @b GLOBALIZED: In this state, the edges are globally
        duplicated on all processors.

  The distribution state is changed by setParallelState().
  Going to a more distributed state primarily means deallocating
  data, but going to a more serial state requires sharing
  of data (communicating).  Currently, collected state for
  LayerEdgeSet objects seems to be unneeded.

  The general attributes of a LayerEdgeSet are:
  - the base LayerNodeSet (a reference to an external object).
  - the ghost cell width to grow the base nodes when checking
    overlaps.
  - the connectivity (table of neighbors for nodes in the
    base LayerNodeSet).
  - the attached partner, if any.
  - the parallel state.

  The connectivity depends on the base LayerNodeSet and the
  ghost-cell-width, so it is discarded when either of these
  is manually changed.

     Representing the map by a LayerEdgeSet

     A special algorithm taking advantage of this restriction
     is used to update this object.  If you want to manipulate
     the edge data generally, @em DO @em NOT use this method.

     @c map is a layer edge from nodes to be removed to nodes
     to be in its place.  If any edges in @c map references
     nodes not locally owned, communication with the owner
     is triggered.  In these cases, it is @em CRITICAL that
     the same mapping is introduced on the owner processes.

     We could do the same with a bridge() operation
     centered at the tail of the map.
     but that requires that @c map maps the unchanged
     nodes in the tail to itself, and it also requires
     doing work to map unchanged nodes to themselves.
     This is a lot of extra overhead when map is very small.
     If @c map maps each unchanged node to itself,
