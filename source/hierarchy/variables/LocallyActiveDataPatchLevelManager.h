/*!
 * @brief Class LocallyActiveDataPatchLevelManager is a utility class for
 * managing data on a patch level where each data item may be defined
 * on a different set of patches; i.e., the data is "locally-active".  
 * A separate object of this class is needed for each patch level on 
 * which locally-active data is defined.  Typical usage involves constructing 
 * an instance of this class with a patch level and then defining the active
 * patches for each patch data integer identifier. Then, this class supports
 * various patch level operations asscociated with the locally-active data,
 * such as allocation and deallocation of data and iteration over patches for
 * which a particular data id is active.
 *
