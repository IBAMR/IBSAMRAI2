/**
 * Class Variable<DIM> provides a description of a variable quantity in 
 * an AMR application.  A variable has the following attributes: (1) a name, 
 * (2) a unique instance number, and (3) a way to create the proper type of 
 * storage on the patches in an AMR hierarchy.  
 *
 * Variable is a base class for all variables; subclasses for each data type 
 * (e.g., cell-centered variables or node-centered variables) will define 
 * member functions to create the appropriate storage management classes.  
 * Note that a variable object is distinct from the storage for the quantity 
 * to which the variable refers.
 *
 * The user defines a set of variables and the role they play in the solution 
 * algorithm when describing an AMR application.  Each variable type knows
 * how to create instances of the associated data objects on patches in an
 * AMR patch hierarchy via the getPatchDataFactory() member function.  For 
 * example, we might have a concrete  myVariable3<double> object that is 
 * derived from Variable3.  The myVariable3<double> object returns a 
 * myVariableFactory3<double> object from its member function 
 * getPatchDataFactory(), and this factory is used to create the 
 * myVariable3<double> objects on the patches.  Thus, a solution algorithm 
 * may be implemented to manage storage of variable quantities through the 
 * abstract interface without knowing the specific concrete variable types
 * in use.  This approach gives maximum flexibility when defining new user 
 * data types and variables and solution algorithms.
 *
 * Each variable is assigned an ``instance number,'' a unique integer
 * identifier numbered from 0 through MAX-1, where MAX is the value
 * returned by static function getCurrentMaximumInstanceNumber().
 * These identifiers can be used to rapidly look up variable instances
 * in a table.  For example, the instance number can be used to map
 * variables to algorithmic data within an algorithm as alluded to above..
 *
 * Variable types for which data exists on the borders of patches (such as node,
 * side, etc.), the data will thus live on the interface between coarse and fine 
 * patch levels.  Thus, it must be specified whether coarse or fine data values 
 * take precedence on the interface between levels.  This information is provided 
 * by the fineBoundaryRepresentsVariable() function.  Each concrete variable subclass
 * defines the behavior of this function.
 * 
 * @see hier::PatchDataFactory
