/*!
 * @brief Class VariableDatabase<DIM> is a Singleton class that manages 
 * mapping information between variables and patch data objects in ways
 * that are configurable to the needs of an application built using SAMRAI.
 * In SAMRAI, a single patch descriptor object is shared by all patches in 
 * an SAMR hierarchy.  This database generates and maintain mappings 
 * (for lookup) between integer patch data indices and either 
 * variable-context pairs or just variables when contexts are not used.  
 * Users define which variables are included in the database, which variable  
 * contexts are in the database, and which contexts are associated with which 
 * variables via registration operations described below.
 *
 * Since the database is a Singleton class, it serves as a globally accessible 
 * container for bookkeeping information related to variable storage on an 
 * SAMR patch hierarchy.  For example, a time-dependent problem may require 
 * distinct "OLD" and "NEW" storage for some quantities.  A context is a name 
 * describing some storage for a collection of variables in a given problem.  
 * Each variable and context pair maps to a unique integer patch data index.  
 * This integer indices are the same for every patch in the hierarchy and
 * so data objects are accessed identically for all patches.
 *
 * Typically, classes that contains numerical routines for patches access
 * the appropriate data in terms of variables.  Classes that provide 
 * solution algorithms manage variable storage in terms of storage "contexts",
 * such as "OLD" and "NEW".   Typical usage of the database for managing 
 * variable storage bookkeeping in this way is as follows:
 * - #   Add variables to the database via the addVariable() function.  
 *       Generally, this is not be needed if the registerVariableAndContext() 
 *       function is used.  However, it is included to deal with complexity 
 *       associated with multiple integrators that share variable data.  In
 *       other words, it circumvents potential problems associated with 
 *       multiple objects owning a single variable.
 * - #   Get variable contexts via the getContext() function.
 * - #   Define variable context pairs in the database using the function
 *       registerVariableAndContext().  This routine returns valid patch
 *       data indices that can be used to manage storage on the
 *       SAMR patch hierarchy.
 *
 * Alternatively, the database can be used to maintain a map between a 
 * single patch data index and a variable that created the patch data factory 
 * at that index.  Such a mapping can be constructed using the functions
 * registerVariablePatchDataIndex() and registerClonedVariablePatchDataIndex().
 * These operations may be helpful when managing variables and contexts is 
 * inconvenient.  However, in contrast to the functions above, these functions do 
 * not allow using a single variable to define multiple patch data indices. 
 * One may use this functionality as follows:
 * - #   Add variable and index pair to the database via the 
 *       addVariablePatchDataIndex() function.   Or, clone an existing
 *       variable index pair via registerClonedVariablePatchDataIndex(). 
 *       Either of these functions will check to make sure that the type 
 *       of the variable matches the patch data index.
 * - #   Get variable for the index via the mapIndexToVariable() function.
 * 
 * Note that the database can be used to allocate and free patch data 
 * indices using the registerClonedVariablePatchDataIndex() and 
 * removeVariablePatchDataIndex() functions.  The registerVariableAndContext()
 * function will also create a new patch data index when needed.  In general,
 * variables and contexts persist once create and cannot be removed from the
 * database.
 *
 * Finally, this database is used in SAMRAI to manage the reading/writing of
 * patch data objects from/to restart files.
 *
 * \verbatim
 * Important notes:
 * 
 *    (1) Having two different variables or two different contexts in 
 *        the database with the same name string identifier is not allowed.
 *        This eliminates the need to resolve ambiguities when querying the
 *        database for variables or contexts based on string identifiers.
 *        The error checking in this class implementation will catch
 *        any attempt to improperly register variables and contexts and
 *        report a descriptive log message.
 * 
 *    (2) It is STRONGLY recommended that variable contexts be generated by 
 *        using the getContext() function in this class.  While contexts 
 *        may be created by other means and passed into the member functions 
 *        of this database class, doing so may produce unexpected results 
 *        due to potentially non-unique integer and name string context 
 *        identifiers.
