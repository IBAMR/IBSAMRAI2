 * @brief Class PatchConfigurationUtilities contains routines that 
 * provide information about spatial relationships among patches 
 * on an AMR patch hierarchy.  Such information is useful for building 
 * operations on patch data that must account for these relationships.  
 * Examples include knowing which patches are neighbors of a given patch 
 * on the same patch level and the positions of those neighbors with 
 * respect to the patch, and knowing which patches on a finer patch 
 * level overlap a given patch, etc.

    * structure contains items that describe the relationship between
    * a patch and one of its neigbors on the same patch level.  
    *
    * The patch number indicates the number of the neighbor patch in
    * the array of patches on the patch level.  The neighbor type and 
    * location index describe the orientation of the neighbor with 
    * respect to the patch.  These values use the conventions of the 
    * boundary type and location index designations, respectively, in 
    * the hier::BoundaryBox<DIM> class.  See that class header file for 
    * details.  The shift vector indicates how the neighbor patch box 
    * must be shifted to to be a neighbor of the patch.  This vector
    * contains non-zero entries only when the patch abuts a periodic
    * boundary.
