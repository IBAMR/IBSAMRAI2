/**
 * Class GridGeometry<DIM> serves as the base class for SAMRAI geometry
 * classes that manage particular grid types (e.g., Cartesian, cylindrical,
 * etc.).  The grid geometry class is responsible for maintaining information
 * about the index space describing the physical domain and computing this
 * information for patches in an AMR hierarchy.  Operations performed by
 * this class include determining which patches are adjacent to the physical
 * domain boundary and computing boundary boxes for patches which decribe
 * how the patch touches the domain boundary (useful for filling ghost cell
 * data for physical boundary conditions).  Member functions that
 * manage the description of the spatial coordinated on the mesh are pure
 * virtual here and must be implemented in an appropriate subclass.
 *
 * Note that the derivation from tbox::DescribedClass is virtual.  The
 * reason for this is to avoid dynamic casting problems for smart pointers.
 * Typically, SAMRAI geometry objects inherit from tbox::Serializable
 * as well as this base geometry class.  Thus, there is usually more than
 * one class hierarchy for geometry objects.  Pointers to base objects
 * may need to be dynamically cast to derived objects in either hierarchy.
