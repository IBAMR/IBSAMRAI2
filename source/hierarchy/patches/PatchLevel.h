 * Class PatchLevel<DIM> is a container class for the patches defined

 * distributed across the processors of a parallel machine, so not all
 * patches reside on the local processor.  Each patch is assigned to one
 * and only one processor.
 *
 * To iterate over the local patches in a patch level, use the patch
 * level iterator class (PatchLevel<DIM>::Iterator).  This iterator
 * will use the owner-computes rule to pick off local patches for
 * computation.
