/*!
 * @brief Class GriddingAlgorithm<DIM> manages gridding operations in
 * SAMRAI.  Specifically, it provides AMR patch hierarchy generation and
 * regridding routines that may be used with a variety of AMR solution
 * algorithms and application-specific numerical routines.
 *
 * The three main functions provided by this class are:
 *    - @b    makeCoarsestLevel()
 *       This routine constructs or repartitions
 *       the coarsest hierarchy level (level 0).
 *
 *    - @b    makeFinerLevel()
 *       This routine will attempt to add a new
 *       finest level to the hierarchy if the
 *       maximum number of levels allows it and
 *       cells on the current finest level are
 *       selected for refinement.
 *
 *    - @b    regridAllFinerLevels()
 *       This routine will regrid all levels finer
 *       than some specified level based on cells
 *       that are selected for refinement on each
 *       level finer than and including the given
 *       level.  This routine may add a new finest
 *       hierarchy level if the maximum number of
 *       levels allows it and cells on the current
 *       finest level are selected for refinement.
 *       Levels may also be removed from the
 *       hierarchy if no cells are tagged.
 *
 *
 * These basic AMR operations are used to generate of individual levels in
 * the AMR patch hierarchy at the beginning of a simulation, and regridding
 * collections of levels during an adaptive calculation.  More details are
 * found in the comments accompanying each member function below.
 *
 * The operations that identify cells for refinement on a single level and
 * initialize data and solution algorithm-specific information that depend
 * on the AMR hierarchy configuration are provided by the data member of
 * type TagAndInitializeStrategy<DIM>.  Operations that cluster
 * tagged cells into a collection of box regions are provided by the
 * BoxGeneratorStrategy<DIM> data member.  Routines that load balancing
 * patches on each level are provided by the LoadBalanceStrategy<DIM> data
 * member.  The collaboration between this class and each of those objects
 * follows the Strategy design pattern.  Each instantiation of this gridding
 * algorithm class is configured with concrete implementations of those
 * routines by passing appropriate objects into this constructor.
 *
 * Initialization of an GriddingAlgorithm<DIM> object is performed via a
 * combination of default parameters and values read from input.  Data
 * read from input is summarized as follows:
 *
 * Required input keys and data types:
 *
 *    - \b    max_levels
 *       Integer value specifying maximum number of levels
 *       allowed in the AMR patch hierarchy.
 *
 *    - \b    largest_patch_size
 *       An array of integer vectors (each has length = DIM) that specify
 *       the dimensions of largest patch allowed on each level in the
 *       hierarchy.  The index of the vector in the array corresponds to the
 *       number of the level to which it applies.  If more values are given
 *       than the maximum number of levels, extra entries will be ignored.
 *       If fewer values are given, then the last element in the array will
 *       be used on each level without a specified input value.  For example,
 *       if only a single value is specified, then that value will be used on
 *       all levels.  See sample input below for more information.
 *
 *    - \b    ratio_to_coarser
 *       Set of max_levels - 1 integer vectors, each of which indicates
 *       the ratio of the index space of a patch level to that of the next
 *       coarser level.  The input for each level must correspond to the
 *       format ``level_n = vector'', where n is the level number and each
 *       vector must have length DIM.  If more values are given
 *       than max_levels - 1 , extra entries will be ignored.  If fewer
 *       values are given, then the last element in the array will be used
 *       for finer levels.
 *
 * Optional input keys, data types, and defaults:
 *
 *    - \b    efficiency_tolerance
 *       An array of double values, each of which specifies the minimum
 *       percentage of tagged cells in each box used to construct patches
 *       on a finer level.  If the ratio of the number of tagged cells in
 *       a box to total cells in the box is below the tolerance value, the
 *       box may be split into smaller boxes and pieces removed until the
 *       ratio becomes greater than or equal to the the tolerance.  The index
 *       of the value in the array corresponds to the number of the level to
 *       which the tolerance value applies.  If more values are given
 *       than max_levels - 1 , extra entries will be ignored.  If fewer
 *       values are given, then the last element in the array will be used
 *       on each level without a specified input value.  For example,
 *       if only a single value is specified, then that value will be used on
 *       all levels.  If no input values are given, a default of 0.8 is used.
 *       See sample input below for input file format.
 *
 *    - \b    combine_efficiency
 *       An array of double values, each of which serves as a threshold
 *       for the ratio of the total number of cells in two boxes into which
 *       a box may be split and the number of cells in the original box.
 *       If that ratio is greater than combine efficiency, the box will not
 *       be split.  This avoids splitting up portions of the domain into
 *       potentially more costly smaller pieces if there appears to be little
 *       to be gained by splitting up the boxes.  The index of the value in
 *       the array corresponds to the number of the level to which the
 *       efficiency value applies.  If more values are given than
 *       max_levels - 1 , extra entries will be ignored.  If fewer values
 *       are given, then the last element in the array will be used on each
 *       level without a specified input value.  For example, if only a single
 *       value is specified, then that value will be used on all levels.  If
 *       no input values are given, a default of 0.8 is used.  See
 *       sample input below for input file format.
 *
 *    - \b    smallest_patch_size
 *       An array of integer vectors (each has length = DIM) that specify
 *       the dimensions of smallest patch allowed on each level in the
 *       hierarchy.  The smallest patch allowed must be at least as great as
 *       the maximum ghost cell width for all variables in the problem.  If
 *       some smaller patch size is given in input, then it will be overridden
 *       with a value consistent with the maximum ghost width.   The index of
 *       the vector in the array corresponds to the number of the level to
 *       which it applies.  If more values are given than the maximum number
 *       of levels, extra entries will be ignored.  If fewer values are given,
 *       then the last element in the array will be used on each level without
 *       a specified input value.  For example, if only a single value is
 *       specified, then that value will be used on all levels.  If no input
 *       is given, a default of the maximum ghost cell width over all
 *       variables is used.  See sample input below for input file format.
 *
 *    - \b    proper_nesting_buffer
 *       An integer array specifying the number of coarse cells by which the
 *       next finer level is nested within the interior of the domain of the
 *       next coarser level when creating a new level.  If more values are
 *       given than max_levels - 1 , extra entries will be ignored.  If fewer
 *       values are given, then the last element in the array will be used
 *       on each level without a specified input value.  For example,
 *       if only a single value is specified, then that value will be used on
 *       all levels.  If no values are given, a default of 1 is used for each
 *       nesting buffer value.  See sample input below for input file format.
 *
 *    - \b    allow_patches_smaller_than_ghostwidth
 *       If the smallest patch size provided in the input file is smaller
 *       than the maximum ghost width of all the registered variables, then
 *       by default the smallest patch size will be grown to the maximum
 *       ghost width.  Set this flag to true to override this default
 *       behavior and to allow the smallest patch size given in the input
 *       to remain in effect.  The default value is false.
 *
 *    - \b    allow_patches_smaller_than_minimum_size_to_prevent_overlaps
 *       In order to enforce minimum patch size restrictions, boxes may be
 *       grown in gridding operations.  This may in turn lead to overlaps
 *       created between boxes. If overlaps are undesirable and you are
 *       willing to relax the minimum size constraints, set this parameter
 *       true.  By default, it is false.
 *
 *    - \b    check_nonrefined_tags
 *       How to resolve user-specified tags that violates proper nesting.
 *       Such tags will not be refined when creating a finer level.  This 
 *       flag gives options for how to handle these tags.
 *       Set to one of these characters:
 *       @b 'i' for ignore (there is no check for violating tags,
 *       and they will be quietly disregarded).
 *       @b 'w' for warn (violating tags will cause a warning and be
 *       disregarded).
 *       @b 'e' for error (violating tags will cause an unrecoverable
 *       exception).
 *       The default is 'w'.  Ignoring is the most efficient because
 *       no checks are required (but this puts the burden of dealing
 *       with unrefined tagged cells on the user.
 *
 *    - \b    check_overlapping patches
 *       Specify whether to check for overlapping patches on a newly created
 *       level, and what to do if any are found.
 *       Set to one of these characters:
 *       @b 'i' for ignore (there is no check for overlapping patches,
 *       and they will be quietly disregarded).
 *       @b 'w' for warn (overlapping patches will cause a warning and be
 *       disregarded).
 *       @b 'e' for error (violating tags will cause an unrecoverable
 *       exception).
 *       The default is 'i'.  The check for overlapping patches may be
 *       expensive, so the use of 'w' and 'e' is recommended only for debugging
 *       purposes.  To prevent the creation of any levels with overlapping 
 *       patches, see the input flag
 *       "allow_patches_smaller_than_minimum_size_to_prevent_overlaps" 
 *
 *    - \b    write_regrid_boxes
 *       Output sequence of refine boxes to file.
 *
 *    - \b    read_regrid_boxes
 *       Read sequence of refine boxes from file.
 *
 *    - \b    regrid_boxes_filename
 *       Filename used for writing or reading refine boxes.
 *       The read and write boxes option is usable only under very specific
 *       circumstances. Please contact the SAMRAI developers at
 *       samrai\@llnl.gov) for more information.
 *
 *    - \b    coalesce_boxes
 *       Whether to coalesce boxes so that load balancer gives better results.
 *       Coalescing can be very expensive.  If regridding cost fails
 *       to scale, this is probably the first option you should consider
 *       disabling.
 *
 *
 * Note that when continuing from restart, the input values in the
 * input file override all values read in from the restart database.
 *
 * The following represents sample input data for a three-dimensional problem:
 *
 * \verbatim
 *
 *    // Required input: maximum bumber of levels in patch hierarchy
 *    max_levels = 4
 *
 *    // Required input: vector ratio between each finer level and next coarser
 *    ratio_to_coarser {
 *       level_1 = 2, 2, 2
 *       level_2 = 2, 2, 2
 *       level_3 = 4, 4, 4
 *    }
 *
 *    // Required input: int vector for largest patch size on each level.
 *    largest_patch_size {
 *       level_0 = 40, 40, 40
 *       level_1 = 30, 30, 30
 *       // all finer levels will use same values as level_1...
 *    }
 *
 *    // Optional input:  buffer of one cell used on each level
 *    proper_nesting_buffer = 1
 *    grow_after_nesting = FALSE
 *
 *    // Optional input: int vector for smallest patch size on each level.
 *    smallest_patch_size {
 *       level_0 = 16, 16, 16
 *       // all finer levels will use same values as level_0...
 *    }
 *
 *    // Optional input: different efficiency tolerance for each coarser level
 *    efficiency_tolerance = 0.80e0, 0.85e0, 0.90e0
 *
 *    // Optional input: combine efficiency is same for all levels.
 *    combine_efficiency = 0.95e0
 *
 *    write_regrid_boxes = TRUE
 *    regrid_boxes_filename = "regrid_boxes_32proc"
 *
 *    coalesce_boxes = TRUE
