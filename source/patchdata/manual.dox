  @page package_patchdata The Patchdata Package

  The Patchdata package defines concrete patch data types used in 
  structured AMR applications.  The data type support is divided into
  eleven subdirectories containing:
  -# @ref package_patchdata_array "fundamental array-based data type support"
  -# @ref package_patchdata_boxgeometry "routines to compute box geometry information for data intersections"
  -# @ref package_patchdata_cell "cell-centered data"
  -# @ref package_patchdata_edge "edge-centered data"
  -# @ref package_patchdata_face "face-centered data"
  -# @ref package_patchdata_node "node-centered data"
  -# @ref package_patchdata_outeredge "outeredge data"
  -# @ref package_patchdata_outerface "outerface data"
  -# @ref package_patchdata_outernode "outernode data"
  -# @ref package_patchdata_outerside "outerside data"
  -# @ref package_patchdata_side "side-centered data"
  -# @ref package_patchdata_index "index data"
  -# @ref package_patchdata_fortran "macros for indexing arrays in FORTRAN rotuines"
 
  The package also defines a set of coarsen and refine operators that 
  are independent of the mesh configuration:
  -# @ref package_patchdata_operators mesh independent operators

  Additionally there is a set of classes that handle data copying of various
  patch data types between different blocks within a multiblock domain.
  -# @ref package_patchdata_multiblock multiblock data translators

  All class names in the Patchdata package are in the namespace "pdat".
