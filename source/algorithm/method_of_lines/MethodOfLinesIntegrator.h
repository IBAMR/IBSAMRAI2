/*!
 * \brief Class MethodOfLinesIntegrator<DIM> implements a spatially
 * adaptive version of the Strong Stability Preserving (SSP) Runge-Kutta 
 * time integration algorithm.
 *
 * The original non-adaptive version of the algorithm is described in
 * S. Gottlieb, C.W. Shu, E. Tadmor, SIAM Review, Vol. 43, No. 1, pp. 89-112.
 * The advanceHierarchy() method integrates all levels of an AMR hierarchy 
 * through a specified timestep.  See this method for details of the 
 * time-stepping process.  Application-specific numerical routines that 
 * are necessary for these operations are provided by the 
 * MethodOfLinesPatchStrategy<DIM> data member.  The collaboration between 
 * this class and the patch strategy follows the the Strategy design pattern.
 * A concrete patch strategy object is derived from the base class to 
 * provide those routines for a specific problem.
 * 
 * This class is derived from the mesh::StandardTagAndInitStrategy<DIM> abstract
 * base class which defines an interface for routines required by the
 * dynamic adaptive mesh refinement routines in the mesh::GriddingAlgorithm<DIM>
 * class.  This collaboration also follows the Strategy design pattern.
 *
 * Initialization of an MethodOfLinesIntegrator<DIM> object is performed 
 * by first setting default values, then reading from input.  All input 
 * values may override values read from restart.  Data read from input is 
 * summarized as follows:
 *
 * Required input keys and data types: NONE
 *
 * Optional input keys, data types, and defaults:
 * 
 *    - \b    order   
 *       integer value specifying order of Runge-Kutta scheme.  If no input
 *       value is given, third order (i.e. order = 3) is used.
 *
 *    - \b    alpha_1   
 *    - \b    alpha_2
 *    - \b    beta 
 *       arrays of double values (length = order) specifying the coeffients
 *       used in the multi-step Strong Stability Preserving (SSP) Runge-Kutta 
 *       algorithm.  If no input is supplied, the default alpha_1, alpha_2,
 *       and beta values are automatically set to correspond to the 
 *       specified order.  
 *
 *
 * The following represents a sample input entry: 
 * 
 * \verbatim
 *  MethodOfLinesIntegrator{
 *     order                 = 3         
 *     alpha_1               = 1., 0.75, 0.33333
 *     alpha_2               = 0., 0.25, 0.66666
 *     beta                  = 1., 0.25, 0.66666
 *  }
 *  \endverbatim
 *
