/**
 * Class TimeRefinementLevelStrategy<DIM> is an abstract base class that
 * defines the interface to level integration and synchronization routines 
 * needed by the hierarchy integration class TimeRefinementIntegrator<DIM>.
 * In particular, this class insulates the hierarchy integrator from the 
 * routines that manipulate data on the hierarchy levels in a problem-specific 
 * fashion.  When the AMR hierarchy integration and regridding sequence 
 * provided by the class TimeRefinementIntegrator<DIM> are appropriate 
 * for some computational problem, a subclass of this base class can be 
 * used to provide the necessary operations to the hierarchy integrator. 
 * That is, a TimeRefinementIntegrator<DIM> object may be configured with 
 * a concrete implementation of this base class by passing the concrete 
 * object into the to the time refinement integrator constructor.
 *
 * Three functions in this class are defined as virtual rather than
 * pure virtual, and default implementations are provided.  This is
 * done to allow for an implementation of this strategy class that is used
 * by the time refinement integrator only for refined timestepping or only
 * for synchronized timestepping.  If an implementation is only used for
 * refined timestepping, getMaxLevelDt() and one version of
 * standardLevelSynchronization() must be overloaded in the concrete class.
 * If an implementation is only used for synchronized timestepping,
 * the other version of standardLevelSynchronization must be overloaded.
 * If an implementation supports both refined and synchronized timestepping,
 * all three virtual functions must be overloaded.

    * Advance data on all patches on specified patch level from current time

    * on the level.  The boolean value last_step indicates whether the 
    * advance step is the last in a time sequence on the level.   Usually,
    * the timestep sequence refers to the steps taken to advance the solution
    * through the time interval of the most recent advance on the next coarser
    * level, if such a level exists.  The boolean regrid_advance is false
    * when the advance is part of the actual hierarchy integration process 
    * and true when the advance is called during time-dependent regridding
    * (e.g., when using Richardson extrapolation).  The default value is false.
    * The last boolean argument is true when the level is in the hierarchy,
    * and false otherwise.  The default value is true.  Usually, this value
    * is false only during time-dependent regridding operations performed
    * on some temporary level; thus, a schedule must be generated for the 
    * level before the advance can occur, for example.
    * 
    * When this function is called, the level data required to begin the 
    * advance must be allocated and be defined appropriately.  Typically, 
    * this is equivalent to what is needed to initialize a new level after
    * regridding.  Upon exiting this routine, both current and new data may 
    * exist on the level.  This data is needed until level synchronization 
    * occurs, in general. Current and new data may be reset by calling

    * 
    * This routine is called from two different points within the 
    * TimeRefinementIntegrator<DIM> class: during the regular time
    * advance sequence, and at the initial simulation time.  The second 
    * call is made to advance the solution on a coarser level ahead in time to 
    * provide time-dependent boundary values for some finer level when 
    * time-dependent regridding is used.  In the first case, the values of
    * the boolean flags are:
    * 


    *    - \b  first_step 
    *        = true for first step in level time step sequence; else, false. 
    *    - \b  last_step

    *    - \b  regrid_advance 
    *        = false.

    * 


    *    - \b  first_step
