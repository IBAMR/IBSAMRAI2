  @page package_algorithm_time_refinement Time Integration with Local Time Refinement

  These classes provide algorithm support for problems that utilize local
  time-refinement during time integration on an AMR hierarchy.  The 
  integration algorithm uses smaller time increments to advance the
  data on finer AMR patch hierarchy levels than those timesteps used
  on coarser levels.  In doing so, the time stepping sequences on different
  levels are interleaved.  The time-refinement integration class orchestrates 
  hierarchy construction, data advancement and synchronization, and dynamic 
  grid refinement processes for such problems.  

  The basic AMR algorithm is attributed to Berger, Oliger, and Colella 
  (see e.g., J. Comp. Phys. (82)1:64-84, 1989) and was motivated by the 
  application of explicit time-integration methods to shock hydrodynamics 
  problems on a structured AMR hierarchy.  The algorithm requires that 
  integration steps on different levels are interleaved since the time 
  increment used on each level is determined by the spatial resolution 
  of the mesh on that level (e.g., CFL condition).  Generally, coarser 
  levels use larger time increments than finer levels.  Thus, data must 
  be synchronized between levels and the dynamic regridding process must 
  be coordinated with the time stepping sequence.

  We have made some enhancements to the original algorithm to make it more
  general and we have implemented it in such a way that it may be applied to 
  a broader class of problems.  The time refinement integration class is 
  coupled to procedures for integrating the data and regridding hierarchy 
  levels that may be application-specific using the Strategy object-oriented 
  design pattern.  Regridding routines are provided by the gridding algorithm 
  class provided elsewhere in the <EM>algorithms</EM> package.  An interface to 
  specific solution methods for manipulating patch data is provided in the 
  time refinement level strategy class.
