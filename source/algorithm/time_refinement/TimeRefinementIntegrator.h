/**
 * Class TimeRefinementIntegrator<DIM> manages time integration over an
 * AMR patch hierarchy using local time refinement for finer hierarchy levels.
 * This class orchestrates hierarchy construction, data advancement and 
 * synchronization, and the dynamic grid refinement processes.  The basic 
 * ideas behind these algorithms are described in several sources on 
 * structured adaptive mesh refinement.  See Berger and Colella, J. Comp. 
 * Phys. (82)1:64-84, 1989 for an introduction to algorithm.  See Trangenstein,
 * SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 16(4):819-839, 1995, or Hornung, PhD thesis, Dept. 
 * of Mathematics, Duke University, 1994 for further discussion.  
 *
 * This class can be used in two different modes:  refined timestepping,
 * which divides they hierarchy's timestep into smaller timesteps on finer
 * levels, or synchronized timestepping, which advances all levels in a
 * hierarchy by the same timestep.  The mode that is used is determined
 * by querying the level integrator that is passed into the constructor.
 * One and only one mode can be used for each instantiation of
 * this class.
 *
 * The algorithm requires that integration steps on different levels are 
 * interleaved since the time increment used on each level is determined
 * by the spatial resolution of the mesh on that level (e.g., CFL condition).  
 * Generally, when using refined timestepping, coarser levels use larger time
 * increments than finer levels.  Thus, data must be synchronized between
 * levels and the dynamic regridding process must be coordinated with
 * the time stepping sequence.
 *
 * The routines in this class are implemented in a manner that is generic 
 * with respect to the details of the level integration and regridding 
 * methods, and the discrete equations being solved.  Thus, the class may
 * be employed for a variety of applications.  Upon construction, an object
 * of this class is configured with routines suitable for a given problem.
 * The TimeRefinementLevelStrategy<DIM> data member supplies routines
 * for advancing levels and synchronizing data on different levels during
 * time integration.  The mesh::BaseGriddingAlgorithm<DIM> data member provides
 * operations that construct and dynamically reconfigure the patch hierarchy.
 * The collaboration between this class and each of those objects follows 
 * the Strategy design pattern.
 *
 * Initialization begins by setting data on the coarsest AMR hierarchy
 * level.  Then, each successively finer level is created and initialized
 * after invoking the regridding procedures on the most recently initialized 
 * level.  This process is performed until either a maximum number of levels 
 * is reached or no further refinement is needed.
 *
 * Time integration is performed by invoking a recursive advance procedure on 
 * the coarsest AMR hierarchy level.  On a level, data is integrated to
 * a given point using a sequence of integration steps, where the size of 
 * each time increment depends on the problem being solved.  After each
 * step on a level, the next finer level (if it exists) is integrated to
 * the same time using a sequence of time steps appropriate for the level.
 * This class may dynamically adjust the time step sequence used on each 
 * level during the data advance process depending on requirements of the
 * integrator and information about stable time step size.  Dynamic 
 * mesh regridding is invoked during the integration process so that 
 * time integration, data synchronization, and mesh movement are coordinated
 * properly.
 *
 * An object of this class requires numerous parameters to be read from 
 * input.  Also, data must be written to and read from files for restart.
 * The input data are summarized as follows.
 *
 * Required input keys and data types:
 * 
 *    - \b    start_time   
 *        double value representing the start time for the simulation.
 * 
 *    - \b    end_time   
 *        double value representing the end time for the simulation.
 * 
 *    - \b    grow_dt   
 *        double value representing the maximum factor by which each
 *        succesive time increment may grow (typically >= 1.0).
 * 
 *    - \b    max_integrator_steps   
 *        integer value representing the maximum number of timesteps
 *        performed on the coarsest hierarchy level during the simulation.
 *
 *
 * Optional input keys, data types, and defaults:
 * 
 *    - \b    tag_buffer   
 *       array of integer values (one for each level that may be refined)
 *       representing the number of cells by which tagged cells are buffered 
 *       before clustering into boxes.  If no input is given, a default value 
 *       equal to the number of steps taken on the level before the next 
 *       regrid is used.
 *
 *
 * Note that the input values for end_time, grow_dt, max_integrator_step, 
 * and tag_buffer override values read in from restart.
 * 
 * A sample input file entry might look like:
 * 
 * \verbatim
 *
 *    start_time            = 0.e0      // initial simulation time
 *    end_time              = 10.e0     // final simulation time
 *    grow_dt               = 1.1e0     // growth factor for timesteps
 *    max_integrator_steps  = 50        // max number of simulation timesteps
 *    tag_buffer            = 1,1,1,1   // a max of 4 finer levels in hierarchy
 *
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * When running in synchronized timestepping mode, an additional input
 * key 'regrid_interval' can be added to specify the number of timesteps
 * between each regrid of the hierarchy.
