/*!
 * @brief A prefabricated Robin boundary condition coefficients
 * for the case where cell-centered data is fixed at the first
 * ghost-cell centers.
 *
 * This class is intended to make the use of the Robin boundary
 * condition utterly trivial for users who who already have the
 * correct values set in the ghost cells.  The motivation for
 * this seemingly needless task is to interpret the requirement
 * that solution is fixed at ghost cell centers to solvers that
 * do not operate directly on the ghost cell values.
 * An example is linear solvers that operate on Ax=b and
 * require that the boundary condition be written as changes
 * to A and b.
 *
 * This implementation of the strategy
 * class RobinBcCoefStrategy<DIM> can be used when ghost cell
 * values are known and have been written to the ghost cells
 * of the data being set.  You provide the patch data index
 * to the cell-centered data, defined with a non-zero ghost
 * cell width, where the ghost cell values can be found.
 *
 * This implementation corresponds to a specific discretization
 * of the Robin formula described in RobinBcCoefStrategy<DIM>.
 * It assumes a linear variation of the data between the first
 * interior and first ghost cells.  It sets up the coefficients
 * such that this linear extrapolation gives the correct value
 * at the ghost cell center.  This results in the coefficient
 * a being 1.0/(1+0.5*h) and g being the a times the ghost cell
 * value.  h is the grid spacing normal to the boundary.
