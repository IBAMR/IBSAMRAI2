  The SAMRAI vector class wraps a collection of patch data components 
  defined over multiple levels in an AMR hierarchy so that the data may 
  be manipulated as though it is a single vector.  Also, included are
  classes which provide vector kernels to the PETSc and Sundials solver 
  packages.  Currently, vector interfaces are provided for real-valued
  vectors only (i.e., where the data is either type <TT>double</TT> or 
  <TT>float</TT>).  If the need for complex-valued vectors arises (e.g., 
  PETSc supports complex vectors), they can be easily added.  Presently, 
  the Sundials vector interface supports only <TT>double</TT>-valued vectors.
  The abstract classes that define the interfaces to the PETSc and Sundials
  packages are includes in the SAMRAI source subdirectories "petsc" and
  "cvode::trio/vector", respectively.  The classes which perform the 
  actual numerical operations used in the vector kernels are found in 
  the "Mathematical Operations" package.
