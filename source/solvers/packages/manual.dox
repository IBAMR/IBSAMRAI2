  @page package_solvers_packages Interfaces to Solver Libraries

  The Solver package provides interfaces to independently-developed solver
  libraries that may be useful when building applications based on SAMRAI.
  Often, these libraries are written in C and do not provide the necessary
  functionality to treat data on AMR patch hierarchies.  The interfaces
  herein facilitate the process of linking C library code to SAMRAI and
  provide wrappers that make it easier to develop C++ vector kernels for
  use with the packages.  Currently, such interface code exists for the 
  PETSc and Sundials libraries.
