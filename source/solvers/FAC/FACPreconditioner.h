/*!
 * @brief Implements the FAC iterative solution procedure
 * for a linear system of equations, Au=f, defined
 * on some subset of levels in an AMR patch hierarchy.
 *
 * The solution is found by applying an FAC algorithm
 * to the composite grid represented in the hierarchy.
 * After each FAC cycle the norm of the residual will be computed over
 * all levels involved.  The FAC iteration will stop when either the
 * maximum number of iterations is reached, or the residual norm on
 * all levels is below the given tolerance. 
 *
 * The user must perform the following steps to use the FAC solver:
 * -# Create a FACPreconditioner<DIM>, providing a valid concrete 
 *    FACOperatorStrategy<DIM> object.
 * -# Set the stopping criteria using the setStoppingParameters() function.
 * -# Set the number of smooting sweeps using the setSmoothingSweeps() 
 *    function.  This is optional; if not used, the default is one sweep
 *    in each case.
 * -# Enable logging to record the FAC residual norms during the FAC
 *    itertion using the setFACLogFlag() function.  This is optional;
 *    the default is to turn logging off.  When loggin is turned on, the 
 *    default mode is to send this information to the application log 
 *    file (i.e., plog). 
 * -# Invoke the FAC iteration process by calling solveSystem(),
 *    providing the vectors u and f, defined on a patch hierarchy
 *    containing the desired range of levels.
 * -# After solving, get solver statistics by viewing the log information
 *    and calling getNumberOfIterations(), getResidualNorm() functions
 *    if desired.

    * @brief Compute hierarchy-dependent data required for solving
    *
    * By default, the solveSystem() method
    * computes some required hierarchy-dependent data before
    * solving and removes that data after the solve.
    * For multiple solves using the same hierarchy configuration,
    * it is more efficient to manually compute, using
    * initializeSolverState(), and remove, using deallocateSolverState(),
    * the hierarchy-dependent data so that it is not done inside
    * solveSystem().  If solveSystem() detects that the solver state
    * is already initialized, it will @em NOT change the state.
    *
    * The vector arguments for solveSystem() need not match
    * those for initializeSolverState().  However, there must
    * be a certain degree of similarity, including
    * - hierarchy configuration (hierarchy pointer and level range)
    * - number, type and alignment of vector component data
    * - ghost cell width of data in the solution vector
    *
    * When assertion checking is enabled, limited checking is done
    * by solveSystem() to help ensure that of the vectors passed
    * to solveSystem() is compatible with the existing state.
    *
    * It is important to remember to reinitialize the solver state
    * when your hierarchy configuration changes.
    *
    * It is safe to initializeSolverState() when the state is
    * already initialized (the state is deallocated and reinitialized).

    * - solution and rhs must have same hierarchy
    * - solution and rhs must have same structure, depth, etc.

    *   for computation).

    * see deallocateSolverState().

    * in sync.
