/**
 * Class Geometry is the base class for SAMRAI geometry classes;
 * it is derived from hier::GridGeometry and is intended to serve as
 * a base class for geometry classes that define specific coordinate
 * system operations for an AMR grid hierarchy.  This transfer geometry class
 * provides a lookup mechanism to search for time interpolation and spatial
 * coarsening/refining operators.  That is, algorithms and applications
 * that manage communication on an AMR hierarchy may query the transfer
 * geometry object for operators that may be applied to specific variables.
 * Typically, the operators are assigned to the transfer geometry object in
 * the constructor of the geometry object that defines the mesh coordinate
 * system (and which is derived from this transfer geometry class).  Additional
 * operators may be added to a tranfer geometry object at any time during
 * program execution. However, each operator must be added BEFORE it is
 * requested or an unrecoverable exception will be thrown and the program will
 * abort.  Also note that operators are added to the heads of the operator
 * lists so that the most recently added operator will be returned if more
 * than one operator satisfies a given request.  See the time interpolation,
 * spatial coarsening, and spatial refinement operator base classes for
 * more information about adding new operators for either new patch data
 * types or new operators for pre-existing patch data types.
