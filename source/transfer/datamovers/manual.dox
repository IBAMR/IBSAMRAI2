  @page package_transfer_datamovers Support for Moving Data on SAMR Meshes

  The Transfer package provides flexible, extensible support for a wide range data
  communication operations involving structured AMR patch hierarchies and levels.
  These classes are partitioned into two categories:

  -# @ref package_transfer_datamovers_standard "classes for data communication where all simulation data live on all patches on the patch levels involved"
  -# @ref package_transfer_datamovers_locallyactive "classes for data communication where simulation data live on subsets of patches on the patch levels involved, so-called 'locally-active' data"
