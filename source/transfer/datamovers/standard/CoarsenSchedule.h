/*!
 * @brief Class CoarsenSchedule<DIM> performs the communication operations
 * to coarsen data from a finer level to a coarser level.  
 * 
 * Typically, data is coarsened from the interiors of source patch components 
 * on the source patch level into interiors of destination patch components on  
 * the destination level.  However, variations are possible for special 
 * situations; see the CoarsenAlgorithm<DIM> class header for more information.
 * Generally, the source patch data must contain sufficient ghost cells to 
 * satisfy the coarsening operators involved.  If a coarsen operator has a 
 * non-zero ghost cell width, then the source ghost cells must be filled before
 * the coarsen schedule is executed.  The communication schedule is executed by 
 * calling member function coarsenData().
 * 
 * Each schedule object is typically created by a coarsen algorithm and
 * represents communication dependencies for a particular configuration
 * of the AMR hierarchy.  The communication schedule is only valid for that
 * particular configuration and must be regenerated when the AMR patch
 * hierarchy changes.  However, as long as the patch levels involved in
 * the creation of the schedule remain unchanged, the schedule may be used
 * for multiple communication cycles.  For more information about creating
 * refine schedules, see the CoarsenAlgorithm<DIM> header file. 
 *
 * NOTE: Algorithmic variations are available by calling the static method
 *       CoarsenSchedule<DIM>::setScheduleGenerationMethod(), which
 *       sets the option for all instances of the class.
