 * @brief Class LocallyActiveDataCoarsenAlgorithm<DIM> encapsulates the 
 * AMR communication pattern to coarsen locally-active data from a finer 
 * level to a coarser level where the data exists on both the coarse and 
 * fine levels.  Most often, data is coarsened from the interiors of 
 * source patch components on the source patch level into interiors of 
 * destination patch components on the destination level.  See comments 
 * for the coarsen algorithm constructor for variations that are possible 
 * for (adventurous?) users. If the coarsening operators require ghost cells 
 * on a source component, then sufficient ghost cell storage must be provided 
 * by the source patch data component, and those ghost cells must be filled 
 * before calling the data coarsening routines.
 *
 * Note that this algorithm class is similar to the CoarsenAlgorithm<DIM>
 * class.  However, unlike the standard coarsen algorithm class, this one
 * does not support resetting communication schedules.
 *
 * Communication algorithms generally consist of three parts: an algorithm,
 * a schedule, and a patch strategy.  The algorithm describes the communication
 * between patch data items but is independent of the configuration of the
 * AMR hierarchy.  Patch data items and their associated coarsening operators
 * are registered with the algorithm.  To generate the communication
 * dependencies for a particular hierarchy configuration, the algorithm
 * generates a schedule based on the current hierarchy configuration.  This 
 * schedule then performs the communication based on the registered data types 
 * and their associated operators.  User-defined pre-processing and post-processing
 * and provided through the abstract patch strategy class.
 *
 * The source patch data space is used during processing to store temporary
 * data.  Thus, the user-defined coarsening operators should operate on the
 * source space by using the patch data with those indices.
 *
 * Note that each coarsen schedule created by a coarsen algorithm remains valid as
 * long as the patches involved in the communication process do not change; thus,
 * they can be used for multiple data communication cycles.
 *
 * Typical usage of a coarsen algorithm to perform data coarsening 
 * on an AMR hierarchy involves four steps:
 * 
 * -# Construct a coarsen algorithm object.
 * -# Register coarsen operations with the coarsen algorithm.  Using the
 *       registerCoarsen() methods(s), one provides source and destination
 *       patch data information, as well as spatial coarsening operators 
 *       as needed.  
 * -# After all operations are registered with the algorithm, one
 *       creates a communication schedule using the createSchedule()
 *       method.  This method identifies the source (fine) and destination
 *       (coarse) patch levels for data coarsening.  Note that when creating 
 *       a communication schedule, a concrete instance of a 
 *       LocallyActiveDataCoarsenPatchStrategy<DIM> object may be required to supply 
 *       user-defined spatial data coarsening operations.
 * -# Invoke the coarsenData() method in the communication schedule to
 *       perform the data transfers.

    * Register a coarsening operation with the coarsening algorithm.  Data
    * from the interiors of the source component on a source (fine) patch level 
    * will be coarsened into the source component of a temporary (coarse) patch 
    * level and then copied into the destination component on the destination 
    * (coarse) patch level.  If the coarsening operator requires data in ghost 
    * cells outside of the patch interiors (i.e., a non-zero stencil width), 
    * then those ghost cells must exist in the source patch data component 
    * and the ghost cells must be filled with valid data on the source level
    * before a call to invoke the communication schedule.   Note that the 
    * source and destination components may be the same in any case.
    *
    * Some special circumstances require that data be coarsened from the 
    * ghost cell regions of a finer level and the resulting coarsened data 
    * should be copied to the destination patch level.  When this is the case, 
    * the optional integer vector argument should be set to the cell width, in
    * the destination (coarser) level index space, of the region around the 
    * fine level where this coarsening should occur.  For example, if the coarser
    * level needs data in a region two (coarse) cells wide around the boundary 
    * of the finer level, then the gcw_to_coarsen should be set to a vector with
    * all entries set to two.  Moreover, if the refinement ratio between coarse
    * and fine levels is four in this case, then the source patch data is required
    * to have at least eight ghost cells.
