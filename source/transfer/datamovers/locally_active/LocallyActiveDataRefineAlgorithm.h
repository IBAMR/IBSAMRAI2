 * @brief Class LocallyActiveDataRefineAlgorithm<DIM> encapsulates the AMR 
 * communication pattern to refine data to, copy data to, or fill physical 
 * boundary data on a destination patch level, where the data may be defined 
 * only on some patches (i.e., the patch data is "locally-active").  The basic 
 * procedure for moving data follows three steps: 
 * -# spatially interpolate data from coarser levels
 * -# copy data from the same level of refinement
 * -# fill physical boundary conditions regions
 * 
 * Note that this algorithm class is similar in functionality and usage 
 * to the RefineAlgorithm<DIM> class. 
 * 
 * Each data communication procedure generally consists of three parts: an 
 * algorithm, a schedule, and a patch strategy.  The algorithm describes 
 * the patch data components and time and space interpolation operations,
 * but is independent of the configuration of the patches in an AMR hierarchy.
 * Patch data items and their associated spatial and time interpolation
 * operators are registered with an instantiation of this algorithm class.
 * To generate the communication dependencies for a particular patch hierarchy 
 * configuration, the algorithm creates a refine schedule based on the state 
 * of a given hierarchy and the information in the algorithm.  The schedule 
 * can then perform the communication operations that move data to the 
 * destination patch level using the associated operators.  User-defined 
 * operations (such as filling physical boundaries and special interpolation 
 * procedures) are provided through a refine patch strategy object.
 *
 * In general, source data is copied into the designated scratch data for
 * temporary processing.  The scratch space must contain sufficient ghost
 * cells to accommodate the stencil width of the given interpolation operators
 * and any physical boundary data that must be filled.  The scratch storage is 
 * copied into the destination data space at the end of the communication process.
 * Thus, copy operations between source, scratch, and destination patch data 
 * objects must be defined.  In general, it is the user's responsibility to 
 * register valid operations with the refine algorithm so that the data 
 * communication can occur.
 *
 * In general, the destination and scratch data components may be the same 
 * (assuming that the scratch component has a sufficient ghost cells width).
 * The source and scratch components SHOULD NOT be the same generally, since 
 * the interiors of the source space may be changed by the use of the 
 * scratch data as temporary work space.
 *
 * Note that each refine schedule created by a refine algorithm remains valid as 
 * long as the patches involved in the communication process do not change; thus, 
 * they can be used for multiple data communication cycles.
 *
 * Typical usage of a refine algorithm to perform inter-patch communication
 * on an AMR hierarchy involves four steps:
 *
 * -# Construct a refine algorithm object.
 * -# Register refine operations with the refine algorithm.  Using the
 *       registerRefine() methods(s), one provides source and destination
 *       patch data information, as well as time and space interpolation
 *       operators as needed.  Two registerRefine() methods appear in this
 *       class; one supports time interpolation, one does not.
 * -# After all operations are registered with the algorithm, one
 *       creates a communication schedule using one of the createSchedule()
 *       methods.  These methods are distinguished by the resulting data
 *       communication pattern (e.g., interpatch communication on a single
 *       level, between two different levels at the same grid resolution, 
 *       interpolation of data between different AMR hierarchy levels, etc.)
 *       Note that when creating a communication schedule, a concrete
 *       instance of a LocallyActiveDataRefinePatchStrategy<DIM> object may be 
 *       required to supply physical boundary conditions as well as user-defined
 *       spatial data interpolation operations.
 * -# Invoke the fillData() method in the communication schedule to 
 *       perform the data transfers.
