Description: README file for variables tests.

This program tests the methods provided by the VariableDatabase class.
In particular, several Variables are created and registered with the 
VariableDatabase.  Then access of Variable, Context, and Descriptor indices
are tested using the getVariable(), getContext(), and 
mapVariableAndContextToIndex() methods.  There are also a section of 
code near the end of main-var_db.C that are errors in the usage of 
the VariableDatabase.  These are removed by the preprocessor in the
distribution version of the code.


Compilation:
              make
  or  
              make vdbtest

Execution:
              ./vdbtest

Output:
              main-var_db.log
