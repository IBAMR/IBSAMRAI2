Description: README file for patch boundary sum tests.

The HierSumTest tests patch boundary node sum operations performed in the
PatchBoundaryNodeSum and PatchBoundaryEdgeSum class.  

The test works as follows:

  1) Initially, set all CELL values to 1.0, except on coarser
     regions that are covered by finer regions where the cell
     values are set to 0.0.

  2) Set node values equal to the sum of the cell values it aligns
     At this point, nodes on patch interiors will equal 2^NDIM because
     thats how many cells border each node.  Nodes on patch boundaries 
     be less than this because they are not getting all cell contributions.

  3) Do the nodal sum operation   

  4) Check that all node values that do not have a finer level overlaying
     them are equal to 2^NDIM.  Those that do have a finer level overlapping
     will be 0.0 on the interior of the patch.  So the final value should
     be either 2^NDIM or 0.0 - there should be no cases where the node
     will have an alternative value.
