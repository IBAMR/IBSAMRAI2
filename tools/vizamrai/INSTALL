		Vizamrai Installation Instructions
=============================================================================

Vizamrai is now based on VTK 4.x, so you need to make sure you have the
correct version of VTK from kitware.  Once you have VTK compiled, installing
the necessary files for vizamrai is not very hard.  Getting all the VTK parts
compiled can be non-trivial.

You should have the following installed:

TCL/TK	
	See 
		http://www.scriptics.com/
	
ITCL
	See
		http://www.sciptics.com/

We are using the ActiveState TCL distribution 8.4.2.0 availible from

	http://www.activestate.com/
	

VTK
	Tested with 4.2.

	See
		http:://www.kitware.com/

*****************************************************************************
Installation overview

Vizamrai is composed of two major parts, a set of scripts and a few
C++ VTK classes which are compiled into a shared library.  Both of
these must be installed for Vizamrai to work correctly.

We use the CMake utility (which is required for building VTK, so you 
should have this installed already).

*****************************************************************************

Step 1.  Building support tools

*****************************************************************************

Make sure VTK, TCL/TK, and ITCL are all installed.  These are all
required for Vizamrai to work.  VTK needs to be compiled with several
options turned on, see the build instructions for VTK for more
information on building VTK.  Make sure your VTK CMakeCache.txt file
has the following options turned on:

BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF

VTK_USE_HYBRID:BOOL=ON

VTK_USE_PATENTED:BOOL=ON

VTK_USE_RENDERING:BOOL=ON

VTK_WRAP_TCL:BOOL=ON

*****************************************************************************

Step 2.  Building vizamrai

*****************************************************************************

Once VTK is built, you have the hard part done.  Since Vizamrai uses
the CMake configuration information from the VTK build, all of the
configuration information should be available.

# First create the directory where you want to build Vizamrai.
# (This is temporary and can be deleted when after the install is done).

mkdir objdir  
cd objdir

#*************************************************************************
# Create an initial CMakeCache.txt file with a couple of defaults
# VTKINSTALLDIR is the where VTK was install at and SOURCDIR is
# the Vizamrai source directory
//Use an installed (versus built from source) version of VTK. Be
// sure that VTK_INSTALL_PATH is correct.
USE_INSTALLED_VTK:BOOL=ON

//What is the path where the file include/vtk/UseVTK.cmake can
// be found
VTK_INSTALL_PATH:PATH=/the vtk install directory

//Where can the hints file be found
VTK_WRAP_HINTS:FILEPATH=/home/smithsg/VTK/vizamrai/Wrapping/hints

//Install path prefix, prepended onto install directories.
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/the vtk install directory
#*************************************************************************


# Run cmake to build the makefiles
cmake <SAMRAI_SOURCE_DIR>/tools/vizamrai

# Everything should be setup so just build and install
make
make install

At this point there should be a "vizamrai" script in the bin directory
of VTK install, just execute this to run the vizamrai application launcher.

=============================================================================

Running Vizamrai

Several sample scripts are included for reading and displaying SAMRAI
datasets.  These are installed in the bin directory of the VTK
directory.  

	vizamrai.1slice filename.vis
	vizamrai.3slice filename.vis

		Cuts the data with one or three slice planes.  

	vizamrai.carpet filename.vis

		Used mostly for looking at 2D data, cuts the box
		with a slice plane and does a height map plot of the
		data.  
		
	vizamrai.iso filename.vis

		Isosurface around a value.

	vizamrai.vol filename.vis

		Volume rendering of a 3D field.  This has very
		limited controls at the moment.  This is also very
		slow.
