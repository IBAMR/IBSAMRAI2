<h3>
Reset</h3>
This resets the display by making centering the objects in the display
window. You need to do this when you load in datasets that are located
in a different physical location in the domain or when you load in datasets
on a different domain.
<h3>
Rotate</h3>
Holding down the left mouse button while you move the mouse rotates the
objects in the display window.
<h3>
Pan</h3>
Holding down the middle mouse button (or Shift + left mouse button) and
dragging will pan the display.
<h3>
Zoom</h3>
Holding down the right mouse button and dragging up will zoom out and dragging
down will zoom in.
<h3>
Zoom Rubber Band</h3>
Holding down the Shift + right mouse button will cause a square to be drawn
on the screen, when you release the mouse button the scene will be centered
zoomed to the area you highlighted. Note for things already zoomed in the
amount of zooming is less than one would expect. This is being looked into.
<h3>
Console Window</h3>
Pressing the "c" key will bring up a command line console at which you
can type TCL commands. This is for advanced users only.
<h3>
Wireframe Mode</h3>
Causes the display to use wireframe mode. On some systems this may be faster
than shading.
<h3>
Surface Mode</h3>
Causes the display to use normal surface shading. This is the default viewing
mode
<h3>
Pick</h3>
Causes the item under the mouse to be picked. This is used to select the
point for the databrowser window.
<h3>
Output Image to File</h3>
Save the current image to the file indicated in the control panel for the
current render window.&nbsp; This is often used when you are in full screen
mode and want to save this image since many OpenGL renderers render directly
to the screen buffer you will pick up any overlapping windows that cover
the render window.
