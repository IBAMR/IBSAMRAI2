			BGL 10 second guide.

Since BGL uses a cross compiler the normal autoconf method for building
SAMRAI will not work.

The current "hack" method is to run the configure process under Linux
with the following options:

../SAMRAI/configure \
	--with-CXX=g++ --with-CC=gcc --with-F77=g77 \
	--with-mpi-include=/usr/apps/mpich/1.2.4/include \
	--with-mpi-lib-dirs=/usr/apps/mpich/1.2.4/lib \
	--with-mpi-libs="mpich pmpich" \
	--enable-char \
	--enable-bool \
	--enable-float \
	--enable-dcomplex 

copy the Makefile.config to the config directory

copy the SAMRAI_config.h to the include directory

Make sure HDF is located in the directory specified in the Makefile.config (see Bor Chan for HDF):

	HDF_ROOT=$(HOME)/local.bgl/hdf5-1.6.3

Then build using make as normal.

To run copy the executable to /bgl/test/$USER/

SRUN batch script example:

Note that input files etc need to be in the /bgl/test/$USER directory
[SGS this may not be required anymore]

        # ConvDiff.srun file
	/usr/local/bin/mpirun \
	        -partition LLNL_128_16 \
	        -nodes 1 \
	        -cwd /bgl/test/smithsg/ConvDiff \
	        -exe /bgl/test/smithsg/ConvDiff/main2d \
	        -args "sphere-2d.input"

To execute the batch script:n

	srun -N1 -b ConvDiff.srun

To check on queue status

	squeue
